those who could afford to obtain Sir Samuel Baker’s
interesting and instructive work, “The Nile Sources
of Abyssinia,” would be acquainted with the locality
and other particulars.</p>

<p>The literature extant on Egypt proper would probably
amount to tons, but that on the Soudan would
occupy a very small space indeed on the library
shelf, for the simple reason that so very few have
travelled through it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span></p>

<p>In November, 1881, I left England to accompany
six gentlemen on an exploring expedition in the
Soudan, and, in view of passing events in Egypt and
that locality, I indulged in the hope that an account
of my journey will not be unacceptable to the public.
I held the post of medical officer to the expedition,
partly on account of my experience in the Turkish
war, where I was continually brought face to face
with dysentery, ague, and other tropical diseases,
which are so easily recognised without any extraneous
assistance, medical or lay, but which are
troublesome to treat, especially when hampered by
an ignorant and fussy interference. Doubtless many
faults of omission and commission may be found in
my book; but I trust that those who criticise it will
do so leniently, and remember that it has been
written during spare hours, when the exigencies of
practice would allow of my seeking recreation by
the use of my pen. “Oh, that mine enemy would
write a book!” was the heartfelt expression of a
vindictive old gentleman, well known for his great
patience. My enemies, I trust, are few; those I
have shall be gratified, though I hope I shall not find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
any who are utterly callous, but will use me in a
gentlemanly fashion.</p>

<p>I have ventured to describe not only my travels
in the Soudan, but the journey from England and
home again, extracted from my journal, which is
most accurate, as I kept it religiously day by day.
Much of the old-world history has been culled from
various sources of information. The Illustrations
of Soudan scenery, natives, and objects of interest
are from rude sketches of my own, elaborated by
Mr. Fanshawe, a perfect master in the art. The
frontispiece is from a photograph taken by Messrs.
Lombardi and Co., of Pall Mall.</p>

<p>Although I am aware of the fact that Mr. F. L.
James has published a book on the Soudan, I have
carefully refrained from reading it, fearing I might
inadvertently use any of his expressions, and also
feeling sure that in <em>some</em> matters we may materially
differ in opinion.</p>

<p>Although I have, on some occasions, written for
the medical journals, I am quite aware that there
may be many faults of style and finish in this my
first effort at a book; such shortcomings I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
ask the reader to overlook. It is but a plain, unvarnished
account of a journey through a territory
hitherto but little known, and as such I trust
it may be of interest to the majority of my
readers.</p>

<div class="chapsub">

<p>LEAVE ENGLAND FOR PARIS—DRUGS AND CLOTHING REQUIRED—A
“SLEEBY” GERMAN—TURIN.</p>

</div>

<p>I was bound for the Soudan, and had arranged to
meet my party at Brindisi on the 21st of November,
1881. I therefore sent on all my heavy baggage by
Peninsular and Oriental steamer to Suez; included
in this was a good-sized medicine chest, well stocked
with drugs for the relief or cure of nearly all the ills
that flesh is heir to.</p>

<p>I am an old campaigner, having served as a
surgeon-major in the Turkish Army in 1876 and ’77,
consequently had a very good idea of what drugs
would be most necessary and useful. Knowing also
that we were going to a very hot part of the globe,
I took as few liquids, such as tinctures, &amp;c., as
possible.</p>

<p>Everything that I could have made in the form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
pills I got Messrs. Richardson and Co., of Leicester,
to do; their coated pills stood the journey splendidly,
and could always be depended on.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary to enumerate all the contents
of the medicine-chest; but I think it might be
useful to those who take a similar journey if I mention
a few things that ought certainly to be taken,
and they are the following: A good stock of quinine,
oil of male-fern, as tape-worm is by no means uncommon;
ipecacuanha, for that formidable complaint,
dysentery; castor oil, opium, Dover’s powder,
iodoform, chlorodyne, calomel, blue pill, and various
other mercurial preparations, much required for complaints
in the Soudan; iodide of potash, carbonate
of soda, powdered alum, sulphate of zinc, sugar of
lead, solution of atropine, solution of ammonia,
Epsom salts, a large bottle of purgative pills, nitrate
of silver (lunar caustic), carbolic acid, lint, a few
dozen bandages, and plaster in a tin. Ointments
are useless, as they soon become quite liquid in such
a hot climate, and run all over the medicine chest,
making a great mess.</p>

<p><i>Clothing.</i>—Of course every gentleman will be provided
with the ordinary European clothing for use
in civilized parts, but such things as nicely-polished
boots, collars, neckties, and so forth, may be easily
dispensed with in the Soudan. The most necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
articles are two or three dozen pairs summer socks,
half-a-dozen thin flannel shirts, three or four silk
shirts, three pairs of <em>brown</em> leather lace-up boots,
and a comfortable pair of slippers, three or four
suits of thin light clothing, a strong jean coat and
trousers, that will not be easily torn by the thorns
whilst hunting, and a pith helmet.</p>

<p>Soldiers cannot march without easy boots, and
travellers cannot travel with comfort unless they
have suitable braces. This may seem a small matter
to talk about, but I have often heard strong language
poured forth at the secession of a trouser-button;
and I know from past experience what a nuisance it
is to be obliged to sew on one’s trouser-buttons. A
long time is spent in searching for a needle and
thread, and a much longer time, by the unpractised
one, in sewing on the button. Now, fortunately,
these annoyances are things of the past, since the invention
of what is known as “the traveller’s patent
buttonless brace.”</p>

<p>It is simplicity itself. Instead of buttons on the
trousers, there are eyelet holes, through which a
little bar attached to the brace—instead of a loop—is
slipped, and there is an end for ever of the
nuisance of buttons coming off.</p>

<p>A good supply of soap for washing clothes should
be taken, also plenty for personal use. Pear’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Soap, I think, is an excellent one in every respect.
Some of our party took thick woollen pads with
them, which they wore over the spine. I did not,
neither do I think them at all necessary.</p>

<p>As I was not due at Brindisi until the 21st
November, I decided to have a ramble through
parts of Italy which I had not before visited.
Accordingly, I left England in the early part of
the month.</p>

<p>On my way to Paris I made the acquaintance of
a German residing in London. We soon got on
conversational terms, and ere long he informed me
that he had not been well lately, and was much
concerned about himself, that one afternoon, feeling
rather tired, he lay down on the sofa, intending to
have a nap. He was so unhappy or unwise as to
sleep for a whole week without once awaking. To
sink into this blissful state of oblivion may have its
advantages, also its disadvantages. On another
occasion he performed the same feat, but indulged
in this lethargic propensity for a much longer period.
If I remember rightly, he observed this condition
during a fortnight. However, I pointed out to him
what an immense advantage this was, as he would
not have his mind worried by the Income Tax, Poor
Rate, and other objectionable collectors; also what
a saving in eating and drinking would be effected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
by this <i lang="la">somnia similima mortis</i> habit of his, and
that balmy sleep was kind nature’s sweet restorer.
Strange to say, my arguments were ineffective, as
he replied that “Sleeb vas all very vell in its way,
but I would rater not sleeb so much as dat, as I
have my business to attend to, for vich I must be
wide-avake.”</p>

<p>We were glad to get off the boat that took us
from Dover to Calais, as both of us suffered from
that miserable complaint, <i lang="fr">mal-de-mer</i>, to some extent.
We reached la belle Paris in the evening,
very glad of a rest. After spending two days very
pleasantly and agreeably in Paris, I took train at
9 p.m. from the Gare de Lyon for Turin. Fortunately,
a French gentleman and I were the only
two occupants of the carriage during the night.
We turned up the arm-rests, each occupied a side
of the carriage, and slept soundly all night. At
Maćon we had breakfast, wash and brush up, then
resumed our journey. Passing through grand
mountain scenery, and quite close to the railway,
we passed a beautiful lake some miles in extent,
the name of which I forget. When we reached
Chambery I lost my agreeable French companion.
In the afternoon we ran through the Mont Cenis
tunnel, the time occupied being just thirty-eight
minutes. The gradient became somewhat steep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and the lovely Alpine scenery glorious and lonely,
now winding through deep gorges, anon running
downwards for miles along the very edge of a
fearful precipice.</p>

<p>I reached Turin in the evening succeeding my
departure from Paris. The station is situated in
the Piazza Carlo Felice, and is a fine, spacious
building. When my luggage had been duly inspected
by Custom House officials, I was permitted
to transport myself and my belongings to an
omnibus from the Hotel Trambetta, whither I was
driven just in time for <i lang="fr">table d’hôte</i>. Immediately
after leaving the station the driver was stopped by
an official, who opened the door, asked if I had
any complaint to make, and looked round to see if
there were any provisions, as the octroi duties
prevail in Italy. I had no complaint; the door was
shut, and off we went.</p>

<p>As I did not intend to remain long in Turin, I
was up the following morning in good time, determined
to see as much of the place as I could in
a short time. The streets are clean and well laid
out, the houses large and handsome generally, and
the town comparatively modern, although it was
originally founded by a tribe called the Taurini,
was the capital of Piedmont during the 14th
century, and the capital of Italy until 1865. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
population is about 208,000, and the University
perhaps the most important in Italy, there being
over 1,500 students.</p>

<p>I should liked to have spent a week in exploring
Turin and the neighbourhood, but had to be content
with the short time at my disposal. I took a walk
down the Via Lagrange, and soon reached the
Palazzo Madama (Piazza Castello). This Palace
was used for the sittings of the Italian Senate
when Turin was the seat of government (1865).
In the early part of last century the mother of
King Amadeus lived in and embellished it.
Opposite this is the Sardinian monument, presented
to the city by the Milanese in 1859, just
after the war, on which, <i lang="it">in relievo</i>, is the figure
of Victor Emmanuel—<i lang="it">Il re galuntuomo</i>—at the
head of his troops. Just beyond the Palazzo
Madama is the Palazzo Reale (Royal Palace). The
exterior is nothing to look at, being plain and
heavy, but the interior is magnificent. From here
I extended my walk to the Giardino Reale (Royal
Gardens), then the Cathedral of Turin, Santa
Giovanni Battista, which was erected in the latter
part of the 15th century by Pintelli. In the chapel
of St. Sudorio, just behind the high altar, is a
small portion of linen cloth in a glass case. This
is a valuable relic, for it is said to be a portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the cloth in which the body of the Saviour was
embalmed. This may, or may not, be true; belief
in the matter is optional. One really gets so
accustomed in Italy to seeing the bones of deceased
saints, a bit of the true cross, a nail of it, and so
on, that the probability is nine out of ten are
sceptical.</p>

<p>From Turin I went by train to Milan. I ought to
have gone direct past Magenta, but by some mistake
I found myself making quite a round-about journey,
<i lang="la">viâ</i> Piacenza and Lodi; however, all’s well that ends
well. I arrived at the hotel in Milan in time for
<i lang="fr">table d’hôte</i>. Now, although I am writing a book
principally on travels and adventures in Egypt and
the Soudan, I dare say my readers will excuse me if
I attempt a description of my travels out and home.
All the places I visited were extremely interesting
to me, and I cannot forbear a little gossip and
relating what I know respecting them. Those who
have not visited these places will perhaps be pleased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
to read my description, and those who have will be
able to compare notes and see if they are correct.
I had been told that the best time to visit Il Duomo—the
Cathedral—was at eight or nine o’clock in
the morning, on account of the splendid view
obtainable from the roof; this I did on the morning
following my arrival, and was richly rewarded for
my trouble. Il Duomo is certainly a magnificent
structure, inferior in magnitude to St. Peter’s at
Rome, but in some respects not an unworthy rival.
It is built of white marble, and is one of the most
impressive ecclesiastical edifices in the world. In
its present form it was commenced in 1387, and is
not yet entirely completed. Its form is that of a
Latin cross, divided into five naves, terminated by
an octagonal apsis, and supported by fifty-two
octagonal pilasters of uniform size, except four,
which, having to bear the cupola, are larger.</p>

<p>Around the exterior are 4,500 niches, of which
above 3,000 are already occupied by statues. In the
interior everything is of the most imposing and
gorgeous description. I said everything, but I
should except an image of wax of the Virgin Mary,
with the infant Saviour in her arms. The waxen
face and arms looked very dirty, her attire was very
commonplace-looking stuff, and I did not think her
rather dirty-looking neck was much improved by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
bit of paltry-looking green ribbon encircling it.
This image would certainly be more suitable at
Madame Tussaud’s than in this beautiful cathedral.
But I will finish with the exterior. The roof is a
perfect forest of marble pinnacles, nearly all
crammed with most valuable marble statues. The
celebrated marble flower-bed contains several thousand
flowers, each distinct and each different in
design. I leave the roof and ascend the tower,
from which I obtain a magnificent view of the
Alpine range, Mont Blanc, Monte Rosa, the St.
Bernard and Matterhorn right away to the Superga
and Mont Cenis.</p>

<p>In the interior we notice the rich stained-glass
windows of the choir, comprising about 350 subjects
of Biblical history, the Gothic decorations of
the sacristy, the candelabra in front of the altar
shaped like a tree, and decorated with jewels, then
the Chapel of St. Borromeo, which is a subterranean
chapel of a most gorgeous and costly character,
as it is one mass of jewels. The shrine and
walls are silver, all inlaid with gold and precious
stones. If I remember rightly, I paid a franc extra
for my visit here, and had the gratification of
seeing the embalmed body of St. Borromeo, with the
valuable rings of office still on his fingers. A golden
crown (presented by the unfortunate Maria Teresa)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
is suspended over his head, and a large crucifix of
splendid emeralds lies on his chest—this, I am told,
was given by the Empress of Austria.</p>

<p>Of course, in Milan, as in all large towns in Italy,
there are any number of beautiful and remarkable
churches. Among the most remarkable edifices are
the church of Sant’ Ambrogio, founded by St.
Ambrose in 387, the churches of Sant’ Eustargio,
San Lorenzo, Santa Maria delle Grazie, with a
cupola and sacristy by Bramante, and the celebrated
Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci; Santa Maria
della Passione, a majestic edifice, with excellent
paintings and a magnificent mausoleum; San Paolo,
San Carlo Borromeo, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Immediately adjoining the Cathedral is a magnificent
square, which was finished on the occasion of
the Austrian Emperor’s visit to Milan in 1875.
This is called the Piazza del Duomo. From this
square I pass through the Galleria Vittorio Emmanuele,
a very fine glass-roofed arcade, or gallery,
connecting the Piazza del Duomo with the Scala
Theatre; the cost of this was about £320,000. It
was commenced in 1865 and opened in 1867. The
glass canopy is illuminated by 2,000 jets of gas,
and when these and the beautiful and brilliant shops
are lighted the effect is charming. The length of
this kind of covered street is 320 yards. La Scala<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Theatre was not open for performances when I was
there, but by the judicious disposition of a franc or
so I obtained admission just to see it. It is, I
understand, capable of accommodating 3,600 spectators.
I next strolled on to the Piazza d’Armi,
which occupies an immense space, obtained by the
demolition of the citadel and its outworks. Part of
it has been converted into an amphitheatre, 800
feet long by 400 feet broad, used in summer for
races and shows, and capable of containing 30,000
spectators. The castle, now a barrack, fronts the
Piazza d’Armi on one side; at the opposite side is
the Porta Sempione, with the fine Arco Sempione,
or Arco della Pace. This is a lofty gateway, with
three passages, built of blocks of white marble,
adorned with reliefs and statues, and bearing inscriptions
commemorating the emancipation of Italy.
My next visit was to the Palazzo di Brera, or Delle
Scienze Lettere ed Arte, containing the Pinacoteca,
or picture-gallery, with a very valuable collection of
paintings and statuary, and containing also the
library of the Academy (170,000 volumes). Besides
this library, Milan possesses the Ambrosian library,
the earliest and still one of the most valuable public
libraries in Europe. There is also a valuable
museum of natural history, a conservatory of music,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a military college, a theological seminary, and a
veterinary school.</p>

<p>Though Milan is one of the most ancient towns
in Lombardy, it has so often been partially destroyed
and rebuilt that few antiquities remain. It is
entered by eleven gates, several of which are magnificent.
Its foundation is attributed to the Insubrian
Gauls; but the first distinct notice of it occurs
B.C. 221, when it was subdued by the Romans,
under whom it acquired so much importance that in
the division of the empire attributed to Constantine
the Great it ranks as the second city of Italy. In
the middle of the fifth century it was sacked by the
Huns, under Attila, and again in the following
century by the Goths; but greater horrors yet
awaited it, for the Goths, who had been driven out
by Belisarius, having regained possession by the aid
of the Burgundians, gave it up to the flames, and put
almost all its inhabitants to the sword. The most
important manufactures are tobacco, silks, cottons,
lace, carpets, hats, earthenware, white-lead, jewelry,
and articles in gold and silver. The spinning and
throwing of silk employs a large number of hands,
and furnish the staple article of trade. The other
principal articles are corn, rice, cheese, and wines.</p>

<p>In the evening of the second day (whilst engaged
in the purchase of everything Milanese in the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
of photographs) I met with a Milan gentleman,
who had lived some years in America, and who
could speak English remarkably well. He was a
genial, good-hearted looking kind of fellow, and we
soon got into an animated conversation. I was
surprised to find how well up he was in English
politics, and as for the Irish question, he could hold
his own with any Englishman; he was, too, a great
admirer of Lord Beaconsfield. When we had had
about an hour’s chat I was about to return to my
hotel; he then asked me how long I was going to
remain in Milan. I told him I intended leaving
next day for Bologna.</p>

<p>“Have you seen the lake of Como?” said he.</p>

<p>“No,” I replied. “I should like to do so very
much, but fear I cannot spare the time, as I have to
be at Brindisi on the 21st.”</p>

<p>“But you must not leave,” said he, “until you
have been there; it is only a run of thirty miles to
Como by rail. I live there. Come to-morrow and
visit me, and I will put you in the way of seeing
Bologna in half the time that you would do it in
without assistance.”</p>

<p>This very kind offer I accepted, and spent next
day a very agreeable time with my new acquaintance,
who was most hospitable and friendly. We
parted with mutual protestations of goodwill, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
I took train for Bologna, which is several hours’
ride from Milan.</p>

<p>Bologna (anciently Bonovia) is one of the oldest,
largest, and richest cities of Italy. It lies at the
foot of the Apennines, between the Rivers Reno and
Savena, 190 miles N.N.W. from Rome. It is five
or six miles in circumference, and is surrounded by
an unfortified wall of brick; it has extensive manufactures
of silk goods, velvet, artificial flowers, &amp;c.
It struck me as being a quaint old city. All the
houses, or nearly so, are built out over the shops
and pavement, supported by large pillars, and
forming a covered way nearly all over the city
which affords shade and shelter to the foot-passengers.</p>

<p>Bologna was long renowned for its university,
founded, according to tradition, by Theodosias, the
younger, in 425, and restored by Charlemagne,
which, in the centuries of barbarism, spread the
light of knowledge all over Europe. It once had
10,000 students, but the number now averages only
300. The university formerly possessed so much
influence, that even the coins of the city bore its
motto—<i lang="la">Bonovia docet</i>. During 1400 years every
new discovery in science and the arts found patrons
here. The medical school is celebrated for having
introduced the dissection of human bodies, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
scientific journals prove that the love of investigation
is still awake in Bologna. The chief square in
the city, Piazza Maggiore, the forum in the Middle
Ages, is adorned by several venerable buildings.
Among them are the Palazzo Pubblico, which contains
some magnificent halls, adorned with statues
and paintings; Palazzo del Padesta, chiefly remarkable
as having been the prison of Eugenis, King of
Sardinia, and son of the Emperor Frederick II.
who was captured and kept here by the Bolognese
for more than twenty years, till his death; and the
church or Ansilica of St. Petronio, which was commenced
in 1390, and is not yet finished. The
palaces and churches are too numerous to make
any remarks on. The leaning towers, Degli
Asmilli and Garisenda, dating from the twelfth
century, are among the most remarkable objects
in Bologna. The former is square, and of massive
brick-work, built in three portions, and diminishing
in diameter to the top. Its height is 321 feet, and
its inclination from the perpendicular 6ft. 10in.
The Garisenda is 161 feet high, and inclines a little
more than 8 feet. Bologna has always been famous
for cheap living, and has been chosen as a residence
by many literary men. Gourmands praise it as the
native country of excellent maccaroni, sausages,
liquors, and preserved fruits. The pilgrimage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the Madonna di S. Lucca, whose church is
situated at the foot of the Apennines, half a league
distant from Bologna, and to which an arcade of
640 arches leads, annually attracts a great number
of people from all parts of Italy. Bologna was
founded by the Etruscans under the name of
<em>Felsina</em>, before the foundation of Rome. In 189
B.C. it was made a Roman colony, and called
<em>Bonovia</em>.</p>

<p>I had been told that the Certosa, or burying
ground, was well worth a visit. It is about 2½ miles
outside the city by the Porta St. Isaia, so I took a
cab and was well rewarded for my trouble, for this
burying ground is the most beautiful and remarkable
in Italy. Here we can walk for hours under
cover between rows of statues and marble tablets of
the greatest beauty. When I returned to my hotel
I found dinner waiting, and afterwards it struck me
that I must seek some more exhilarating mode of
amusement after my visit to the Certosa. I accordingly
made my way to the Teatro Communale, one
of the three best theatres in Italy, San Carlos at
Naples and La Scala in Milan taking precedence.
The opera was “Mefistofele,” splendidly mounted and
well supported by artistes. The orchestra was large
and all that could be desired by the most fastidious
critics, and there are plenty of them in a Bolognese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
audience. Boxes are in <em>every</em> tier in the house, and
the effect is very pretty.</p>

<p>As I had to start for Brindisi at 3 a.m. on Sunday,
November 20th, I had not much time for sleep,
notwithstanding which I got between the sheets
until then, when I was conveyed to the station and
finished my nap in the train.</p>

great commotion over-head quite incompatible with
sleep. I therefore turned out, and was soon on deck
watching the busy scene. Some little time after I
had breakfasted I discovered two of the party
which I was to accompany, Messrs. F. L. James
and E. L. Phillipps. We were to meet three more
at Cairo, and one at Suez, to complete the party.</p>

<p>No one would care to remain very long in
Brindisi, as it is a most uninteresting place notwithstanding
its antiquity. I remember once, in
1877, spending a few hours there, and was then very
glad when my train left for Naples. Brindisi
(ancient <em>Brundusium</em>) was, if I remember rightly,
the birth-place of Virgil. It is a sea-port and fortified
town 45 miles from Taranto. In ancient times
it was one of the most important cities of Calabria.
It is said by Strabo to have been governed by its
own kings at the time of the foundation of Tarentum.
It was one of the chief cities of the Sallentines,
and the excellence of its port and commanding
situation in the Adriatic were among the chief
inducements of the Romans to attack them. The
Romans made it a naval station, and frequently
directed their operations from it. It was the scene
of important operations in the war between Cæsar
and Pompey. On the fall of the Western Empire
it declined in importance. In the eleventh century
it fell into the possession of the Normans, and
became one of the chief ports of embarkation for the
Crusades. Its importance as a sea-port was subsequently
completely lost, and its harbour blocked.
In 1870 the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation
Company put on a weekly line of steamers
between Brindisi and Alexandria for the conveyance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
of Her Majesty’s eastern mails, and at the same
time made it a post of transit for goods brought
from India by these steamers to be forwarded to the
north of Italy by rail. From this cause the imports
of Brindisi have suddenly risen in importance.</p>

<p>About 12 mid-day on the 21st November, we got
under way with 110 first-class passengers on board,
the weather was fine, much warmer than in Turin
and Milan, and the sea smooth, which I was
thankful for; 22nd the same; 23rd fine and sea
smooth until about 4 p.m., when the sea became
rough, and I very uncomfortable, undesirous
of dinner and very desirous of being quietly
settled in my berth, which I sought without loss
of time, knowing by a past bitter and sour experience
that I should ere long present a pitiable
spectacle. During the night the sea became so
rough that the port-holes of the cabins had to be
closed, so that in addition to feeling excessively
sick I was almost suffocated, as the weather was
very warm. On the morning of the 24th, at 10
o’clock, we landed at the far-famed city of
Alexandria.</p>

<p>Even in sunny Italy I had felt the weather, in
the neighbourhood of Turin, Milan, and Bologna,
cold and frosty enough in the morning for an
overcoat. At Brindisi it was not so cold, but as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
we neared the African coast the sky grew warmer
and warmer, and tinged, so to speak, with a reflection
of the Libyan desert, a soft purple hue, rather
than the deep blue of Italy. Only those who have
witnessed sunset in Africa can form any conception
of the beautiful tints reflected from the rocks and
sands; there you see the soft purple, lovely crimson,
pale gold, rose and violet colours all shading off
into one another in the most charming manner. I
have never seen anywhere such glorious sunsets as
in Africa.</p>

<p>Having but a short time to stay in Alexandria, I
made good use of it in exploring the place.
Through what strange vicissitudes has this ancient
city passed. Alexandria was founded by Alexander
the Great, B.C. 332, on the site of a village called
Rakôtis, or Racoudah. Its founder wished to make
it the centre of commerce between the east and
west, and we know how fully his aspirations have
been realized. It stood a little to the south of the
present town, was 15 miles in circumference, and
had a population of 300,000 free inhabitants, and at
least an equal number of slaves. So distinguished
was it for its magnificence, that the Romans ranked
it next to their own capital, and when captured by
Amru, general of the Caliph Omar (A.D. 641), it
contained 4,000 palaces, 4,000 baths, 400 theatres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
or places of amusement, 12,000 shops for the sale
of vegetables, and 40,000 tributary Jews. But we
are getting on a little too fast. As I said before, it
was founded B.C. 332, by Alexander the Great,
who is said to have traced the plan of the new city
himself, and his architect, Dinarchus or Dinocrates
(the builder of the temple of Diana at Ephesus)
directed its execution. The city was regularly
built, and traversed by two principal streets, each
100 feet wide, and one of them four miles long.
Campbell says: “He designed the shape of the
whole after that of a Macedonian cloak, and his
soldiers strewed meal to mark the line where its
walls were to rise. These, when finished, enclosed
a compass of 80 furlongs filled with comfortable
abodes, and interspersed with palaces, temples, and
obelisks of marble porphyry, that fatigued the eye
with admiration. The main streets crossed each
other at right angles, from wall to wall, with beautiful
breadth, and to the length (if it may be
credited) of nearly nine miles. At their extremities
the gates looked out on the gilded barges of the
Nile, of fleets at sea under full sail, on a harbour
that sheltered navies, and on a lighthouse that was
the mariner’s star and the wonder of the world.”</p>

<p>One-fourth of the area upon which it was built
was covered with temples, palaces, and public buildings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Conspicuous upon its little isle was the
famous lighthouse of Pharos, the islet being connected
with the city by a mole. Under the Cæsars,
Alexandria attained extraordinary prosperity; large
merchant fleets carried on a reciprocal commerce
with India and Ethiopia, and its industrial population
were chiefly employed in the weaving of linen,
and the manufacture of glass and papyrus.</p>

<p>The Alexandrians were turbulent, and several
times revolted under the Ptolemies and the Romans.
Cæsar was obliged, in B.C. 47, to put down a terrible
insurrection in this city. Under the emperors,
Alexandria suffered a series of massacres, which
gradually depopulated it. In 611, Chosroës, King
of Persia, seized it, but his son restored it to the
emperors. In 641, Amru—whom I spoke of just
now—took it by storm, after a siege of 14 months,
and a loss of 23,000 men. The Turks captured it
in 868 and 1517.</p>

<p>So from time to time Alexandria has been the
scene of the greatest splendour, adorned by marble
palaces, temples, and obelisks, also of great squalor,
and covered with mud huts; passing under the
sway of Persian, Greek, Roman, and Turk, and at
the time I am writing this (March, 1884) I think I
may safely say under the <em>sway</em> of Great Britain,
although not belonging to this country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>In the early part of this century, under the
vigorous, but most unscrupulous, rule of Mehemet
Ali (who was appointed Pasha of Alexandria, and
afterwards of all Egypt), Alexandria became again
a thriving and important place.</p>

<p>It is said that in the character of the population,
at least, there still remains a strong resemblance to
the ancient city of the Ptolemies. Sullen-looking
Copts replace the exclusive old Egyptians, their
reputed ancestors. Greeks and Jews, too, swarm
as before, both possibly changed a little for the
worse. The mass of Levantines and (with, of
course, honourable exceptions) Franks, who make
up the sum of the population, may, I think, without
any exaggeration, be designated as the off-scourings
of their respective countries. The streets swarm
with Turks in many-coloured robes, half-naked,
brown-skinned Arabs, glossy negroes in loose white
dresses and vermilion turbans, sordid, shabby-looking
Israelites in greasy black, smart, jaunty, rakish
Greeks, heavy-browed Armenians, unkempt, unmasked
Maltese ragamuffins, Albanians and Europeans
of every shade of respectability, from lordly
consuls down to refugee quacks, swindlers, and
criminals, who here get whitewashed and established
anew. Here you see a Frank lady in the last
Parisian bonnet, there Egyptian women enveloped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to the eyes in shapeless black wrappers, while dirty
Christian monks, sallow Moslem dervishes, sore-eyed
beggars, and naked children covered with flies,
present a shifting and everlasting kaleidoscope of
the most undignified phases of Eastern and Western
existence.</p>

<p>The great square, or Grande Place, is the chief
place of business and resort. It is a quarter of
a mile long, and 150 feet wide, paved on each side,
with a railed garden in the centre, planted with
lime-trees, and having a fountain at each end.
Here are the principal shops and hotels, the English
consulate and church, banks, offices of companies,
&amp;c. The buildings are all in the Italian style,
spacious and handsome, or, rather, were when I
visited it. Most of the ancient landmarks are fast
disappearing. The site of Cleopatra’s Palace is
now occupied by a railway station for the line to
Ramleh, seven miles distant, overlooking the bay
of Abaukir, the scene of Nelson’s victory over the
French fleet in 1798. Of course, I could not be in
Alexandria without paying a visit to Pompey’s
pillar, or, more properly, Diocletian’s pillar. It is a
grand column, and occupies an eminence 1,800 feet
to the south of the present walls; its total height is
98 feet 9 inches. It is a single block of red granite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
on the mounds overlooking the lake Mareotis and
the modern city.</p>

<p>An account of the ancient and modern history of
Alexandria would fill a volume of the most stirring
interest. I, however, will be content with giving
to my readers a very small portion of a volume on
Alexandria, as I shall have a good deal yet to say
on Cairo and neighbourhood, and still more to say
on the Soudan.</p>

<p>It was to Alexandria that science, fostered by the
munificence of the Ptolemies, retired from her
ancient seat at Heliopolis. “The sages of the
Museum, who lodged in that part of the palace of the
Lagides, might there be said to live as the priests
of the Muses, taking the word in its wide sense, as
the patronesses of knowledge. They had gardens,
and alleys, and galleries where they walked and conversed,
a common hall where they made their repasts,
and public rooms where they gave instruction
to the youth who crowded from all parts of the
world to hear their lectures.” This museum, a
unique establishment in literary history, was founded
by Ptolemy Soter, King of Egypt, who died B.C.
283, and was greatly enlarged by his son Ptolemy
Philadelphus and the succeeding Ptolemies. In
connection with the museum was the Alexandrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Library, the most famous and the largest collections
of books in the world, and the glory of Alexandria.
Demetrius Phalereus, after his banishment from
Athens, is said to have been its first superintendent,
when the number of volumes, or rolls, amounted to
50,000.</p>

<p>If the other Ptolemies were as unscrupulous in
obtaining books as Energetes is said to have been,
it is no wonder that the library increased in magnitude
or value. We are told that he refused to sell
corn to the Athenians during a famine unless he
received in pledge the original manuscripts of
Aschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. These were
carefully copied, and the copies returned to the
owners, while the King retained the originals.
Various accounts are given of the number of books
contained in the library at its most flourishing
period, when Zenodotus, Callimachus, the poet
Eratosthenes, of Cyrene, and Appolinius Rhodius
were its librarians. Seneca states the number at
400,000; Aulus Gellius makes it 700,000. Some
reconcile the discrepancy by making the statements
refer to different periods, while others believe that
the larger figure includes more than one collection.
That there were more than one collection is known.
The original, or Alexandrian library <i lang="fr">par excellence</i>,
was situated in the <em>Brucheion</em>, a quarter of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
city in which the royal palace stood; and besides
this there was a large collection in the Serapeion,
or temple of Jupiter Serapis, but when or by whom
this was founded we do not know. The former was
accidentally burned during the Julius Cæsar’s siege
of the city, but was replaced by the library of
Pergamus, which was sent by Antony as a present
to Cleopatra. The Serapeion library, which probably
included the Pergamean collection, existed
to the time of the Emperor Theodosius the Great.
At the general destruction of the heathen temples,
which took place under this emperor, the splendid
temple of Jupiter Serapis was set upon and gutted
(A.D. 391) by a fanatical crowd of Christians at the
instigation of the Archbishop Theophilus, when its
literary treasures were destroyed or scattered. The
historian Orosius relates that in the beginning of
the fifth century only the empty shelves were to be
seen.</p>

<p>A valuable collection was again accumulated in
Alexandria, but was doomed to suffer the same
fate, being burned by the Arabs when they captured
the city under the Caliph Omar in 641. Amru, the
captain of the Caliph’s army, would have been
willing to spare the library, but the fanatical Omar
disposed of the matter in the famous words:—“If
these writings of the Greeks agree with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Koran, there could be no need of them; if they
disagree, they are pernicious, and ought to be
destroyed;” and they were accordingly used for
heating the 4,000 baths in the city. Just before
the time of Mehemet Ali, Alexandria was a miserable
place of a few thousand inhabitants, cut off
from the valley of the Nile by the ruin of the
ancient canal. Under his rule it greatly revived
in political and commercial importance, and the
re-opening of its canal has restored to its harbour
all the trade of Egypt.</p>

<p>The principal articles of export are cotton, beans,
peas, rice, wheat, barley, gums, flax, hides, lentils,
linseed, mother-of-pearl, sesamum, senna, ostrich
feathers, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Those who are not given to pedestrian exercise
can easily avail themselves of a cab or donkey, and
they will find the streets, which are spacious and
handsome, very pleasant to traverse, as they are
all well paved in the city; but the dust outside the
walls covers the ground from four to six inches
deep, and in combination with the intense glare
of the sun, and the wretched hovels of the natives,
produces the ophthalmia so common, especially
among the Arabs. Owing to the want of proper
drainage, what would otherwise be a salubrious
site is subject to malarious disease and the plague.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>I have spoken of the Alexandrian library; quite
as much may be said of the Alexandrian school;
combined, they may be justly considered the first
academy of arts and sciences.</p>

<p>The grammarians and poets are the most important
among the scholars of Alexandria. These
grammarians were philologists and literati, who
explained things as well as words, and may be
considered a sort of encyclopedists. Such were
Zenodotus the Ephesian, who established the first
grammar school in Alexandria; Eratosthenes, of
Cyrene; Aristophanes, of Byzantium; Aristarchus,
of Samothrace; Crates, of Mallus; Dionysius the
Thracian; Appolonius the sophist; and Zoilus. To
the poets belong Appolonius the Rhodian, Lycophron,
Aratus, Nicander, Emphorion, Callimachus,
Theocritus, Philetas, Phanocles, Timon the Philasian,
Scymnus, Dionysius, and seven tragic poets,
who were called <em>Alexandrian Pleiads</em>.</p>

<p>The most violent religious controversies disturbed
the Alexandrian church until the orthodox
tenets were established in it by Athanasius, in the
controversy with the Arians.</p>

<p>Among the scholars are to be found great mathematicians,
as Euclid, the father of scientific
geometry, and whose work, I distinctly recollect,
was a great bore to me in my younger days;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Appolonius, of Perga, in Pamphylia, whose work
on conic sections still exists; Nichomachus, the
first scientific arithmetician; astronomers, who
employed the Egyptian hieroglyphics for marking
the northern hemisphere, and fixed the images and
names (still in use) of the Constellations, who left
astronomical writings (<i lang="la">e.g.</i>, the <cite>Phœnomena</cite> of
Aratus, a didactic poem; the <cite>Spherica</cite> of Menelaus;
the anatomical works of Eratosthenes, and especially
the <cite>Magna Syntaxis</cite> of the geographer
Ptolemy), and made improvements in the theory
of the calendar, which were afterwards adopted into
the Julian calendar; natural philosophers, anatomists,
as Herophilus and Erasistratus; physicians
and surgeons, as Demosthenes Philalethes, who
wrote the first work on diseases of the eye;
Zopyrus and Cratenas, who improved the art of
pharmacy and invented antidotes; instructors in
the art of medicine, to whom Asclepiades, Loranus,
and Galen owed their education; medical theorists
and empirics, of the sect founded by Philinus. All
these belonged to the numerous association of
scholars continuing under the Roman dominion and
favoured by the Roman emperors, which rendered
Alexandria one of the most renowned and influential
seats of science in antiquity. With this passing
glance at Alexandria, we will journey on to Cairo.</p>

<p>In former times, before the introduction of railways,
the traveller to Cairo had to go by canal, hire a
boat, servant; procure a carpet, mattress, and
bedding; lay in a store of provisions, and a variety
of minor articles that would fill a page or two to
mention. Now we can go comfortably by rail in
a few hours, the distance being something like 120
miles, I think.</p>

<p>We pass, <i lang="fr">en route</i>, Lake Mareotis and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Mohmoudieh Canal, cultivated land near Alexandria,
then a good deal uncultivated and desert;
but as we approach Cairo, we see large tracts of
cultivated land, all accomplished by irrigation,
and I am told that as much as two or three crops
in the year can be obtained off these lands without
very great labour. A hot sun can always be
depended on. The agricultural labourer has not
to go through the laborious work of ploughing and
manuring as in England. All he has to do is to
scratch the ground, and put in the seed in the
fertilizing alluvium which has been brought down
from the rich lands of Meroe and portions of
Abyssinia by the Athara river and its tributaries,
the Salaam, Augrab, and the greater stream,
Tacazze or Settite. All these rivers cut through
a large area of deep soil, through which, in the
course of ages, they have excavated valleys of great
depth, and in some places of more than two miles
in width. The contents of these enormous cuttings
have been delivered upon the low lands of Egypt
at the period of the inundations. The Athara is
the greatest mud-carrier, then the Blue Nile, which
effects a junction with the White Nile at Khartoum.</p>

<p>The White Nile is of lacustrine origin, and conveys
no mud, but an excess of vegetable matter,
suspended in the finest particles, and exhibiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
beneath the microscope minute globules of green
matter, which have the appearance of germs. When
the two rivers meet at the Khartoum junction, the
water of the Blue Nile, which contains lime,
appears to coagulate the alluminous matter in
that of the White Nile, which is then precipitated,
and forms a deposit; after which the true Nile,
formed by a combination of the two rivers, becomes
wholesome, and remains comparatively clear, until
it meets the muddy Athara. The Sobat river is a
most important tributary, supposed to have its
sources in the southern portion of the Galla
country.</p>

<p>For the foregoing information on these rivers I
am indebted to an article of Sir Samuel Baker’s,
which I read with great interest in the <cite>Contemporary
Review</cite>; and I daresay many of my readers will
thank me for reproducing it.</p>

<p>After this slight digression, I will continue my
journey to Cairo. At the stations were numbers
of women and children with refreshments for the
traveller in this land, where the sun always shines
with a burning heat; women with goolehs of water
to sell; children naked, or nearly so, with sugar-cane,
melons, oranges, dates, fresh sugar-cane, figs,
&amp;c. Vast numbers of these poor creatures were
afflicted with ophthalmia, their eyelids covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
flies, which they take no notice of whatever, many
of them blind, or partially so, blind beggars; one
and all, whether they can sell anything or not, continually
uttering the cry of “Backsheesh, backsheesh,
howaga,” which comes faintly on my ears
as the train leaves the station. As we journey on
there is much to be noticed. Now we pass a camp
of Bedouins in the desert; next a large grove of
date-palms (the owner of which has to pay a tax on
every tree). Here the domestic buffalo walks round
and round a circle; he is working the sakia or
water-wheel, which winds up the water for irrigation.
This is also taxed. Scattered all over the
country are innumerable shadoofs, another mode,
and the most ancient, of obtaining water; there
the stately-looking camel strides along, looking
intensely unconcerned. Trotting past him on his
little donkey is an Arab in loose, white, flowing
robes, and turbaned head. At one time we pass
squalid, wretched-looking mud-huts; anon Nubians,
as black as coal, working in the fields. We arrived
at Cairo in the evening about seven, and were at
once driven off to the well-knewn Shepheard’s
Hotel. The <i lang="fr">cuisine</i> is all that could be desired, and
every attention is paid to insure the comfort of
visitors. Mr. Grose, the manager, is a particularly
obliging and attentive gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Cairo (in Arabic, <i>Kahira</i>, which signifies
<em>victorious</em>) is the capital city of Egypt. It lies on
the east bank of the Nile, in a sandy plain, and
contains old Cairo, Boulac (<em>the harbour</em>), and new
Cairo, which are, to a considerable degree, distinct
from each other. The city itself, separate from the
gardens and plantations which surround it, is about
10 miles in circuit, has 31 gates, and 240 irregular
unpaved streets, which during the night are, or
were, closed at the end of the quarter, to prevent
disturbances. The houses are for the most part
built of brick, with flat roofs, and the interior of many
of them is very sumptuous. The chief square of
Cairo, El-Esbekiah, has a magnificent area, the
centre of which is laid out as a garden, and is
annually inundated by the overflowing of the Nile.
It is surrounded by the finest palaces. There is in
it a monument to General Kleber. The inhabitants
of the city and suburbs, in 1871 353,851, are
Arabs or Mahomedans, Coptish Christians, Mamelukes,
Greeks, Syrians, Armenians, Jews, and
natives of various countries of Europe. The castle,
or citadel, situated on a rock, containing Joseph’s
Well, 276 feet deep, is the residence of the Pasha.
There are 80 public baths, 400 mosques, two Greek,
12 Coptish, one Armenian, and one English church,
36 synagogues, and many silk, camlet, tapestry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
gunpowder, leather, linen, and cotton factories.
Among the mosques, which, though many of them
are in ruins, form the most conspicuous edifices of
the city, the most remarkable is that of Sultan
Hassan, which is built of blocks of polished marble,
obtained from the outer casing of the pyramids, or
pyramid rather, for, if my memory serves me right,
they are from the great pyramid of Cheops at Gizeh.
It has a beautifully ornamented porch, richly corniced
walls, and many tall minarets. Here is also a
Mahomedan high school, a printing office and
25,000 volumes. The largest convent of dervishes
is at Cairo. It was built in 1174. The traffic of
Cairo is very great, since it is the centre of communication
between Europe, the Mediterranean Sea,
Asia, and the North of Africa, and is upon the railway
from Alexandria to Suez. The principal
bazaars are the Ghoreah and Khan Khalel. Goods
are disposed of there by public auction, and the
different bazaars exhibit different kinds of merchandise.
Ibrahim Pasha commenced a public library
in 1830, and in 1842 a European Society, called the
Egyptian Literary Association, was established.
Mehemet Ali introduced schools for elementary
education, and the Church of England Missionary
Society has two schools.</p>

<p>Cairo was founded by Jauhar, general of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Caliph Moez, in the year of the Hegira 368, or A.D.
969, on the site of the Egyptian Babylon. Moez
afterwards made it his capital, which distinction it
retained until the overthrow of the Mamelukes by
Sultan Selim in 1517. Saladin extended and fortified
it in 1176. It was repeatedly attacked by the
Crusaders, particularly by St. Louis in 1249. It
was occupied by the French from 1798 to 1801,
when it was recovered by the Turks with the assistance
of the English. A great fire occurred there
in February, 1863; advantage was taken of it to
improve the town.</p>

<p>Our military occupation of Egypt (or shall I say
that it is simply a “measure of police?”), and events
that are now transpiring there, are a sufficient
excuse (if one were required) for dealing shortly
with the ancient history of Cairo and the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Soon after our arrival at Shepheard’s Hotel, when
we had restored ourselves to our personal comfort,
our host provided us with a good dinner, to which
we did ample justice, and as the weather (although
the end of November) was like a summer’s evening
in England, we enjoyed the usual after-dinner
cigarettes in the balcony, which is a very pleasant
lounge, even in the day time, as it is quite sheltered
from the blazing sun. I soon strolled off to bed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
with the idea of obtaining a good night’s rest, so
that I should awake refreshed and fit for a pilgrimage
to the various shrines of intense interest with
which Cairo and its neighbourhood abounds. I
have visited and seen all that was interesting in
Rome, once the mistress of the world—Corinth, once
the seat of learning and the abode of a most
polished people; Ephesus; have stood on the ancient
Acropolis of Athens, the plains of Troy, celebrated
by Virgil; explored Misenum, Pateoli, Baiæ, Pompeii,
and Herculaneum, all rich in historical associations;
but compared with the remains of ancient
cities near Cairo these places were of yesterday’s
growth, and were not even thought of until ages
after the glory and high civilization of the people in
the land of the Pharaohs had passed away. When
Abraham entered the Delta from Canaan with his
countrymen, moving about in tents and waggons, the
Egyptians were living in cities enjoying all the advantages
of a settled government and established
laws; had already cultivated agriculture, parcelled
out their valley into farms, and reverenced a landmark
as a god.</p>

<p>While Abraham knew of no property but herds
and movables, they had invented records and wrote
their kings’ names and actions on the massive
temples which they raised. They had invented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
hieroglyphics and improved them into syllabic
writing, and almost into an alphabet. The history
of Greece <em>begins</em> with the Trojan war, but <em>before</em> the
time of David and <em>before</em> the time of the Trojan war,
the power and glory of Thebes had already passed
away. About 1,000 years B.C. Shishak the conqueror
of Rehoboam, son of Solomon, governed all
Egypt; at his death it was torn to pieces by civil
wars. After a time the kings of Ethiopia reigned
in Thebes, and helped the Israelites to fight against
their Assyrian masters. This unsettled state of
things lasted nearly 300 years, during which, as the
Prophet Isaiah foretold, “Egyptians fought against
Egyptians, brother against brother, city against
city, and kingdom against kingdom.” At last the
city of Sais put an end to this state of things and
under the Sais kings Egypt enjoyed again a high
degree of prosperity. They were more despotic
than the kings of Thebes, and struggled with the
Babylonians for the dominion of Judæa.</p>

<p>Probably many of my readers are aware that M.
Ferdinand de Lesseps was not the originator of a
canal to the Red Sea, for Pharaoh Necho, one of
the Sais kings, began it from the Nile. His sailors,
circumnavigated Africa; he conquered Jerusalem,
and when the Chaldees afterwards drove back the
Egyptian army the remnant of Judah, with the Prophet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Jeremiah, retreated into Egypt to seek a refuge
with King Hophra.</p>

<p>523 B.C. the Persians became masters of
Egypt, and behaved with great tyranny. Cambyses
plundered the tombs and temples, broke the statues,
and scourged the priests. They ruled for 200 years;
then the Greeks, B.C. 332, the Romans, B.C. 30,
and on the division of the Roman Empire, A.D. 337,
Egypt fell to the lot of Constantinople. In A.D.
640, just 670 years after the Roman conquest,
Egypt was conquered by the followers of Mahomet,
and now, in this year of grace, A.D. 1884, we are
rather upsetting the late order of things, but
whether for good or evil time will show.</p>

<p>In this age of progress, it may seem strange to
say so, but Egyptian landlords had much the same
tastes 3,000 years ago as English landlords have
now. They were much addicted to field-sports.
Not only does history tell us so, but I have seen
often in their sculptures and paintings that this was
so. Even on the tomb and chapel of King Phty at
Sakkara, which is said to be over 5,000 years old, I
saw scenes of fowling, fishing, hunting, running
down the gazelle, spearing the hippopotamus, of
coursing and netting hares, of shooting wild cattle
with arrows, and catching them with the lasso.
They had fish ponds, game preserves, and game<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
laws, they were fond of horses and dogs, kept good
tables, gave morning and evening parties, amused
themselves with games of skill and chance, were
proud of their ancestors, built fine houses and furnished
them handsomely, and paid great attention
to horticulture and arboriculture.</p>

<p>This certainly reads like contemporary history;
but I will go further. To use a well-known expression,
“would you be surprised to hear” that
the tenants paid the same proportionate rent as the
British farmer of to-day? The average gross produce
of a farm here was £8 an acre, average rent
about 32s. an acre—just one-fifth—the exact rent paid
by the tenants of Potiphar, Captain of the Guard,
and of Potipherah, Priest of On, Joseph’s father-in-law,
and the same was paid to Pharaoh himself by
his tenants. At that time the whole acreage of the
country was divided into rectangular estates. One-third
belonged to the king, two-thirds in equal proportions
to the priestly and military castes; and
these were cultivated by another order of men, who,
for the use of the land, paid rent—one-fifth of the
gross produce—to the owner.</p>

<p>Altogether I spent nearly a fortnight in Cairo,
and feeling a great interest in the historical associations
of this ancient place and the neighbourhood,
I resolved to see and learn as much as I could of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
them during my short stay. In the morning, after
early breakfast, I amused myself for a short time
by sitting in the shade of the extensive balcony in
front of Shepheard’s Hotel, which overlooks the
street, and is contiguous to it. The scene which
presented itself to my gaze was truly Oriental in
character. Now I see a few camels stalking silently,
slowly, and sedately on, variously laden—some
with baskets of large stones for building purposes,
others with long pieces of timber on each side,
others with skins of water and so on; then an
Arab lady on donkey-back, riding after the manner
of men, and covered from head to foot in unsightly
black wrappers, having just a slit in them, through
which can be seen a large pair of lustrous dark
eyes, and down the bridge of her nose are some
brass-looking ornaments, resembling as much as
anything a row of thimbles inserted in one another.
A Turkish lady’s dress and yashmack (covering
worn over the face) is much more becoming, and her
nose is not ornamented by the addition of the
thimble arrangement. The Turkish ladies wear (in
Constantinople) quite a thin white muslin yashmack
over their faces. This does not conceal very much
of the features, which, as a rule, are very beautiful.
The Egyptian ladies wear a black yashmack, which
conceals all except the eyes. Report says they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
ugly; if so, they are quite right to do so. Next I
see a carriage driven along preceded by two sais, or
runners, to clear the way, and it is surprising what
a pace they go at with a long, swinging trot. They
are picturesquely and gorgeously dressed, each bearing
a long wand, and wearing a tarboosh (Turkish
fez), the long thick blue tassel of which floats
gracefully over the shoulders, and not at all unlike
what some of the ladies in Athens wear, except that
their tassels are black. Then we see blind, or
partially blind, beggars, of whom there are vast
numbers, Coptic and Mahomedan women and
children, girls with baskets of flowers and lovely
roses, sweet-meat, fly-whisp, water, and fruit-sellers,
conjurers, snake-charmers, one and all soliciting
“backsheesh,” dusky, brown-skinned Arabs clad in
loose-flowing robes and white turbans, coal-black
Nubians, Jews, Greeks, Armenians, and Europeans
of all shades of colour, religion, and politics.
Here, in fact, in this city of Saladin and of the
“Arabian Nights Entertainments” creations (which
once seemed to be so fanciful and visionary) kindle
into life and reality as I look upon everything
around me.</p>

<p>The apartments of an Arab house of the well-to-do
are decorated with Arabesque lattices, instead of
glass windows. Inside are luxurious divans heaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
with soft cushions, instead of sofas and chairs; and
instead of the rattling of cabs, carts, and tramcars
we hear the wild, shrill, trilling note of the Arabian
women indicating some occasion of joy or sorrow, or
hear the equally peculiar long drawn-out note of
the muezzin from some minaret calling the faithful
to prayer.</p>

<p>Very near to our hotel, on the opposite side, are
always to be found a number of donkeys ready for
hire, and very good little donkeys they are. I can
see the head, legs, and tail of a donkey; the remaining
portion of him is almost concealed by a great
padded saddle, to which is attached a very inconvenient
pair of stirrups, into which you <em>may</em> get the
tips of your toes, and sometimes a portion of the
foot, but if the foot is not small, or is so unfortunate
as to possess a respectably-sized bunion, you
must be content if you can get the tips of your toes
only in the stirrup; this, again, slips down to the
right or left, according as you put more pressure on
one side or the other. There are no girths, but one
long strap placed around the saddle and donkey
very insecurely fixes the former. If my reader has
not been accustomed to circus-riding, I assure him
he would experience some difficulty at first in exhibiting
his powers of equitation before the Egyptian
public under these circumstances, and I have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
more than one individual come into ignominious
contact with mother earth; fortunately he has not
far to go ere he humbles and tumbles himself in
the dust.</p>

<p>My first experience was this: as soon as I was
seated and had rammed the tip of my boot into the
stirrup, the donkey-boy shouts, “Ha—ha.” This
warning note the donkey knows full well, and off he
goes at a kind of running trot, which is all right.
Soon these ha-ha’s increase in frequency, and ere
long I can fancy myself a second Mezeppa. The
imp behind now accompanies his peculiar yell with
a sharp prog of a pointed stick, and the donkey
takes a very pointed cognisance of it, for now “He
urges on his wild career.” In the wide, open streets
this rapid mode of progression has an exhilarating
tendency, but in the narrow streets of the bazaars
unguarded human beings fly to the right of me, unguarded
human beings fly to the left of me, and
imprecations, not loud, but deep, in an unknown
tongue, fall on my untutored ear as my donkey indiscriminately
cannons on to the unobservant. A
few words about these donkeys, and donkey-boys so
called. Most of the latter are not boys at all, but
full-grown men, notwithstanding which they are
always called donkey-boys. These and their donkeys
are quite an institution in the East. The donkeys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
own all kinds of popular English names, and of
course (if the owner may be believed) are possessed
of every good quality. Most of the donkey-boys
have picked up more or less English, and in expatiating
on the good qualities of their beasts are
accustomed to interlard their speech with the
strong language of the West, and you would be surprised
to hear how promptly they will consign a
fellow donkey-boy to an inhospitable and much-warmer
region than Cairo, and to the care of a much
blacker individual than themselves. The reader is
here called upon to exercise his or her imagination.
I had myself derived considerable amusement when
watching an intending pilgrim securing one of these
donkeys. To be forewarned is to be forearmed; I
flattered myself that by making my selection sure
before I got amongst them, my tactics would be
most successful, but as the sequel will show, I was
grossly deceived, having reckoned without my host,
or hosts I ought to say. First intending pilgrim.
He descends the steps of Shepheard’s Hotel, and
moves towards the donkeys—a fatal movement. Instantly
the air is thick with donkeys and donkey-boys.
The latter yell frantically a chorus of praises
concerning the useful quadrupeds, which are most
adroitly and with surprising dexterity brought one
after the other under his very nose, whilst the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
victim is jostled about in the most bewildering and
unpleasant manner. I have been both a spectator
of and an actor in this performance, and I can safely
say the spectator derives by far the greatest amusement.</p>

<p>I resolved to pay a visit to the bazaars and some
of the mosques of note. Having, as I thought,
gained some experience by observing the misfortunes
of others, I executed a strategic movement which I
fondly imagined would turn out successful. I had,
from a distance selected my donkey; then cunningly
walked up and down the pavement smoking a
cigarette, apparently with no object in view.
Suddenly I darted on to the enemy, but alas! I
found myself in an absolute whirlwind of donkeys
and their troublesome two-legged attendants, who
yelled into my ears and bumped me about until I
was quite unable to recognise the donkey I had
selected. Beauties were here represented, such as
Mrs. Cornwallis West, and Mrs. Langtry; national
names, such as John Bull, and Yankee-doodle;
mythical names, such as Jim Crow and Billy Barlow.
One donkey rejoiced in the name of Dr. Tanner,
another in that of Madame Rachel; others, again, had
been honoured with the names of statesmen, such
as Prince Bismarck, John Bright, Sir Stafford
Northcote, Lord Randolph Churchill, Mr. Gladstone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Mr. Parnell, Lord Beaconsfield, and others.
“Dr. Tanner, he debbil to go—he berry good
donkey indeed, hakeem,” said the owner. However,
I declined him, as he was said to be a <span class="smcapuc">FAST</span> one
(excuse the joke), and as this was entirely an
Eastern question, I could not help thinking that
Lord Beaconsfield would certainly be the most
likely to carry me safely through. I therefore
selected him, and had every reason to be satisfied with
him and his secretary, Lord Rowton <i lang="la">alias</i> Ibrahim,
the donkey-boy, whom I employed on several subsequent
occasions. He proved a very good conductor,
for he took me through the various bazaars, Tunis,
Algiers, Turkish, Persian, and Arab, &amp;c., pointing
out all places of note and interest <i lang="fr">en route</i>. Ibrahim
soon got to know that I was a doctor, and so indeed
did all the attendant Arabs about the hotel. He,
like hundreds of his countrymen, suffered from
ophthalmia, and when I was out with him he said—</p>

<p>“Hakeem, what I do with my eyes? They very
bad sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said I, “you bring me a bottle to-morrow
morning, and I will give you something for them,”
little thinking of the consequences. The lotion did
his eyes a great deal of good, and two days afterwards
a great many of his friends called, to all of
whom I gave lotion. During my stay here, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
some months afterwards on returning from the
Soudan, I was, every morning, employed after
breakfast at my medicine chest preparing eye lotions
for my Arab friends, invocations for the blessings
of Allah being my recompense. The poor fellows
appeared to be grateful, and I dare say it was
genuine, not like a canting old Irish vagrant woman,
who, if you give a hunk of bread and cheese to, will
exclaim—</p>

<p>“Thank yer honour kindly!” and as long as she
is in hearing keep muttering, “Och! sure now,
there’s a kind jintleman for ye, me darlint. Sure
now he is intirely an illigant jintleman; only for
him I would not have a bite this morning, that’s
sure for ye. May Heaven guide him and the blessed
Virgin protect him!” Then out of hearing it is,
“Och! the dirty spalpeen! What will I do wid
this? May the curse of Cromwell light on ye for a
murthering Sassenach. What will I do honey? and
I not had a sup of gin this blessed day to keep the
cowld out of me poor thrimbling ould body!”</p>

<p>But I am digressing. One day I took a donkey
ride to old Cairo, and with others from the hotel
visited the dancing dervishes, and the house said
to have been inhabited by our Saviour. Old Cairo
is about two miles distant from Grand Cairo. It
was at old Cairo that the child Jesus, with Joseph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and Mary, lived for a time, having fled from the
bloody, persecuting Herod. The place said to have
been His exile home is now a small Greek church. The
steps to the room are very much worn, but great
care is taken of every part of it; silver lamps, hung
from the ceiling, are burning night and day, and no
one is allowed to enter without the presence of a
Greek priest. It certainly is not difficult to believe
that, considering the mild Syrian atmosphere, and
the absence of rain, the building may be much more
than 1,800 years old.</p>

<p>The dancing dervishes next engaged our attention.
When in Constantinople I visited the dancing
dervishes at Pera and the howling dervishes on the
other side of the Bosphorus at Scutari. The dancing
dervishes wear a dress of greyish material, which
reaches a little below the knee, and is confined by a
girdle round the waist. When they spin round like
Teetotums this looks like an open umbrella. The
head is covered by a curious-looking, tall, conical
felt hat without any brim.</p>

<p>The word itself, Dervish, or Dervise, is of Persian
origin, and signifies poor. It denotes the same
amongst Mahomedans as <em>monk</em> with Christians.
The observance of strict forms, fasting and acts of
piety, give them a character of sanctity amongst
the people. They live partly together in monasteries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
partly alone, and from their number the Imams
(priests) are generally chosen. Throughout Turkey
they are freely received, even at the tables of
persons of the highest rank. Among the Hindus
they are called <em>fakirs</em>. There are throughout Asia
multitudes of these devotees, monastic and ascetic,
not only among the Mahomedans, but also among
the followers of Brahma. There are no less than
thirty-two religious orders now existing in the
Turkish Empire, many of whom are scarcely known
beyond its limits; but others, such as the Nakshbendies
and Mevlevies, are common in Persia and
India. All these communities are properly
stationary, though some of them send out a portion
of their members to collect alms. The
regularly itinerant dervishes in Turkey are all
foreigners or outcasts, who, though expelled from
their orders for misconduct, find their profession
too agreeable and profitable to be abandoned, and
therefore set up for themselves, and, under colour
of sanctity, fleece honest people. All these orders,
except the Nakshbendies are considered as living in
seclusion from the world; but that order is composed
entirely of persons who, without quitting the
world, bind themselves to a strict observance of
certain forms of devotion, and meet once a week to
perform them together. Each order has its peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
statutes, exercises, and habits. Most of them
impose a novitiate, the length of which depends
upon the spiritual state of the candidate, who is
sometimes kept for a whole year under this kind of
discipline. In the order of the Mevlevies, the novice
perfects his spiritual knowledge in the kitchen of
the convent. The numerous orders of dervishes
are all divided into two great classes, the dancing
and the howling dervishes. The former are the
Mevlevies, and are held in much higher estimation
than the other class, and are the wealthiest of all
the religious bodies of the Turkish Empire. Their
principal monastery is at Konieh, but they have
another at Pera, a suburb of Constantinople, where
they may be seen engaged in their exercises every
Wednesday and Thursday. These are performed in
a round chamber, in the centre of which sits their
chief or sheik, the hem of whose garment each
dervish reverently kisses on entering the chamber,
after which they go and range themselves round
the chamber with their legs tucked under them.
When all the dervishes have entered and saluted
the sheik, they all rise together and go in procession
three times round the room, the sheik at their
head. Each time they do obeisance to the empty
seat of the sheik on coming to a certain part of the
room. The procession ended, the sheik again takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
his place in the centre, and all the others begin
dancing round him, turning on themselves at the
same time that they move round the room. The
arms are extended, the palm of the right turned
upward and the palm of the left downward, to
indicate that what they receive from heaven with
the right they give away to the poor with the left,
while sounds of music are heard from a neighbouring
gallery. The movement at first is slow, but as
the dervishes become excited they become more
animated, and revolve so quickly that they look like
tops spinning round; at last they sink exhausted on
the floor. After a while they renew their exertions,
and repeat it several times. The whole is concluded
by a sermon.</p>

<p>The howling dervishes do not confine themselves
in their exercises to the dancing just described.
They accompany them with loud vociferations of
the name of Allah, and violent contortions of the
body such as are seen in persons seized with
epileptic fits. And even these extravagances are
not so bad as those which were formerly practised,
when the dervishes, after working themselves into
a frenzy, used to cut and torture themselves in
various ways with apparent delight. The sheiks of
all orders have the credit of possessing miraculous
powers. The interpretation of dreams, the cure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
diseases, and the removal of barrenness, are the
gifts for which the dervishes are most in repute.
Had I to live in such a hot climate as Cairo, I should
feel thankful that our religion does not necessitate
such violent bodily exertion as that which these
dervishes indulge in. The road to old Cairo was
very, very dusty, and the weather excessively hot, as it
always is in the day time. We left the dancing
dervishes after remaining about half-an-hour, and
rode back to our hotel in the afternoon too late for
any further explorations that day. On the following
day I spent some hours in a very enjoyable and
also instructive manner, namely in inspecting the
priceless articles in the Baulac Museum. This
museum, I suppose, contains some of the most
ancient things in this world, and I regret very much
that I could not devote a week to inspecting the
contents of it instead of a few hours. I should
have seen the treasures contained here, and known
very little concerning them (as there was no
catalogue), had I not been so fortunate as to get
into conversation with Brusch Bey, the curator, a
most intelligent and obliging gentleman, whose
heart is enthusiastically in his work. He was kind
enough to spend about two or three hours with me
and enlighten me on very many things which would
have been a sealed book to me but for him. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
lay before us one grand discovery of 32 kings and
queens, who had ruled Egypt in the dim distant
ages long ago. The gilding on the inner coffins was
as perfect and untarnished as it was the week they
were executed, although thousands of years have
rolled by since the handy craftsman was engaged on
them. They were covered with information that
none but an Egyptologist could decipher. In this
museum was pointed out to me a picture said to be
the most ancient in the world, it was a painted
picture of Egyptian geese, as well done, I should
imagine, as any ordinary painter of the present day
could do it. There were bronzes and polished marble
statuary as perfect in appearance as when they left
the workmen’s hands, and, as far as I could judge, as
well finished as they would be by workmen of the
present day, although 2,000 or 3,000 years old. An
ingenious and strong little cabinet engaged my
attention some time; the doors of hard wood were
well carved and the joints as exquisitely dove-tailed
in as any man of the present day could make them.
In a glass case I saw basket-work, a chair, rope,
twine, seals, rings, javelins, slings, food and seeds as
they were found in an ancient tomb, the mason’s
mallet cut out of a solid piece of wood, precisely
the same shape and size as those in use here at the
present time, jewellery well-finished and solid-looking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and many other things too numerous to mention.
On carefully examining this valuable and
interesting collection, some of which were 3,000,
4,000, or 5,000 years old, I could not help thinking
that they served well to illustrate the highly civilized
condition of the people at so remote a period.</p>

<p>To give details of all the interesting things in
this museum would occupy too much time to the
exclusion of other matter, but there are two things
that call for notice on account of their very great
antiquity. One is a wooden statue, which has been
carved out of a solid block of very hard wood, and
is that of a man about 5ft. 7in. in height. As one
stands in front of that wooden statue gazing for a
short time, he almost appears to be endowed with
a soul and the power of speech, so excellent is the
execution of the figure, and so expressive the face;
no one can doubt for a moment that he was the
creation of a high civilization. It was found in a
tomb at Sakhara and belongs to one of the early
dynasties of the old primæval monarchy, and is
absolutely untarnished by the thousands of years it
has been reposing in that tomb; there is actually no
sign of decay. The antiquity of that statue
astonishes me, and I dare say it will my readers.
Brusch Bey told me that it was supposed to be
5,400 years old, and that probably it was older than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
that. The other statue, that of Chephren, the
builder of the second Pyramid, with his name inscribed
upon it, is in Diorite, one of the hardest kind
of stones, carefully executed and beautifully polished.
These Egyptians were evidently people of considerable
forethought, and when they wanted their names
and deeds to live long after them engraved on
tablets of stone, they selected the most durable they
could, and it is more than probable that had they
contemplated building such houses of Parliament as
we have built in London, they would have selected
a hard, not a soft stone, that continually requires
patching up. Well, the features of Chephren’s
statue are uninjured, and Brusch Bey and I gazed
on them just as they were seen by Chephren and
his court 5,000 years ago. It was discovered by
Mariette Bey, at the bottom of a well, which
supplied the water used for sacred purposes in the
sepulchral temple attached to Chephren’s Pyramid.
It was no doubt originally erected in the temple,
and was probably thrown into the well by the
barbarous Hyksos or iconoclastic Persians.</p>

<p>During the late military operations, or “police
measures,” grave apprehensions for the safety of
the Baulac Museum arose, but fortunately it escaped
the violence of the mob. The greater part of one
day was occupied by a visit with my familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Ibrahim to the mosques of note, the citadel, tombs
of the Caliphs and Mamelukes. Another day I got
a companion from the hotel to accompany me to the
petrified forest, some miles out in the desert. It
covers an area of about 15 miles. All this space is
pretty thickly strewed over with what appears to be
trunks and branches of trees. I took hold of what
appeared exactly like the wooden branch of a tree,
and so it had once been, but for ages it had lain
here, a solid piece of very hard stone. The place is
an absolutely desolate one in the desert, with not a
sign of vegetation in sight. Whether these had
been washed here during the flood or had once
grown in the neighbourhood or not, or how they
came there, I never could ascertain, although I have
sought for information on the subject in all directions.
No one seems to be able to tell me anything
about the origin of this petrified forest, and I have
not hitherto found a book containing any allusion
to it. We returned to Cairo by the Mokhottam
hills behind the citadel somewhat late in the afternoon,
consequently had to urge on our donkeys so
that we should see Cairo by sunset. We were here
just in time to do so, as there is scarcely any twilight
in the East; the transition from day to night does
not occupy very many minutes. The picturesque
panorama that opened out to our view well repaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
us for our trouble. There before and beneath us
lay Cairo with its innumerable mosques and minarets,
the Nile with the peculiar Nile boats called
dahabeahs floating peacefully on its surface. Here
and there the stately camel strides silently on, veiled
women and turbaned Arabs in loose flowing robes,
groves of palm trees, while nearer to us we see the
half-ruined tombs of the Caliphs and Mamelukes,
the citadel and the beautiful mosque of Mehemet
Ali full of carved columns of alabaster. To the late
burning heat which we encountered in the desert
succeeds a soft, balmy, dry air, and the beautiful and
varied hues of the setting sun is reflected from the
glittering mosques and minarets, rocks and sands,
presenting a picture which will not soon fade from
my memory, and which requires the poetry, eloquence,
and pen of a Byron to adequately describe.
In striking contrast to the beautiful scene we had
just enjoyed was the wretched-looking houses of the
Arabs, the squalor, dirt and miserable pathways on
the hill-side which we encountered immediately
afterwards as we pursued our homeward journey.</p>

<p>A YOUNG AMERICAN AT SHEPHEARD’S HOTEL—DRIVE TO THE
PYRAMIDS OF GIZEH—ASCENT AND EXPLORATION OF THE
PYRAMID OF CHEOPS—THE SPHINX.</p>

</div>

<p>We arrived at our hotel rather tired, and felt it
quite a relief to stretch our legs out straight after
having them cramped up so long whilst on our
donkeys. Having partaken of a good dinner, I
adjourned to the balcony with a cigarette, sank
into an easy lounge, and communed with my own
thoughts. I had not been here long before I discovered
sitting near me an individual, apparently
about 23 years of age, whose nether extremities
rested on the back of a chair, his feet being parallel
with his chin. He was dressed in a somewhat
<i lang="fr">outré</i> manner, the lower limbs being encased in
check prolongations; the body in a brown coat,
something like a sack in shape; the throat was
surrounded by a loose, turn-down collar, and loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
neckerchief, whilst the summit of this curious
specimen of humanity was crowned by a huge felt
hat, with an enormous brim. The clouds of smoke
which he emitted from his mouth rivalled a young
volcano; he was smoking a cigar, and did not forget
to expectorate in a most profuse and dangerous
manner, so much so that, feeling in somewhat
dangerous proximity to the fire of his artillery, I
got up with the intention of escaping any little
salivary accidents; but my silent companion had
his eye on me, and thus suddenly addressed me in the
decidedly nasal accent and twang peculiar to the
inhabitants of America—</p>

<p>“Stranger, I guess this Cairo is a tarnation
rummy place?”</p>

<p>Seeing no reason to dispute this by no means
rash assertion, I readily conceded the point; and,
by way of carrying on the conversation, ventured
to remark that—</p>

<p>“It certainly is a very curious and interesting old
place, and the inhabitants no less so.”</p>

<p><i>He</i>: “That’s so, sirree; they <em>are</em> queer beggars,
and so <em>are</em> their wimen.”</p>

<p>This also was an indisputable fact, and I acknowledged
that they were a strange race, strongly
wedded to old customs, and as strongly opposed
to innovations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p><i>He</i>: “Stranger, yew don’t roost here, I guess?”</p>

<p><i>I</i>: “No; I am just travelling for a few months,
and shall leave Cairo in two or three days’ time.”</p>

<p><i>He</i>: “In what line may you be travelling,
stranger?”</p>

<p>Now, of course I knew what he meant, but
thought his remarks were so original, not to say
impertinent, that I must not omit this opportunity
of extracting some amusement, and provide material
for my diary. I therefore replied—</p>

<p>“Oh! I came by the P. and O. line to Alexandria,
by rail here, and now my lines have fallen in pleasant
places.”</p>

<p>“Guess yew don’t quite fathom me. What’s yer
business, and where are you going tew?” said he.</p>

<p>I then gave him the names of a number of places
in Egypt and the Soudan, enumerating them as
rapidly as I could, so that I am quite sure my nasal
friend was very little the wiser for the information.</p>

<p>He enshrouded himself in a huge cloud of smoke,
vigorously expectorated once more, and regarding
me fixedly for a moment, exclaimed—</p>

<p>“By Jupiter! stranger, that’s a large order.
Opening up a trade or colon<em>ize</em>, I guess.”</p>

<p>I suppose, because I told him I was travelling
with six other gentlemen, he thought we were going
to start a colony somewhere, and then annex all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
adjacent country, which, by the way, would certainly
be a very good thing for the Egyptians and the
Soudanese, and very probably for ourselves also.
However, I gave him to understand that we were
simply travelling for pleasure, exploration, and
sport. Notwithstanding this, my Yankee acquaintance
was determined to turn me inside out if he
could; he, therefore, was so complimentary as to
say—</p>

<p>“Well, now, I guess you are a gentleman?”</p>

<p>To this I answered—</p>

<p>“Thanks; I trust your surmise is a correct one;”
and I might have said, but I did not, “Sorry I
cannot return the compliment.”</p>

<p>I have often heard of the pertinacity of an
American reporter, but it appears to me that the
bump of inquisitiveness is not by any means confined
to them, but pervades the whole community.
There was no shilly-shallying, no delicate, nicely-worded
hints and adroitly-put questions; but my
interrogator was determined to find out all about
me if he could, and so he asked me how long I had
been in Cairo, how old I was, if I was married or
single, how many children I had, if I lived on my
money, and lots of the most impertinent questions,
and finally finished up by saying, “Guess you are
a Britisher?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Having, as he thought, pumped me pretty considerably,
he was good enough to take me into his
confidence, and tell me all about himself, and his
belongings, and “<em>hew</em> his father had left him a
pile,” adding, “Guess I spend some, and move
about a bit.” I could not help saying—</p>

<p>“I think you are wise to pursue that course;
travel will improve you a good deal, and, like the
marble statuary in the Baulac Museum, it will put
on a little polish.”</p>

<p>He eulogised the States and the inhabitants
thereof, and was apparently under the impression
that America was the only place worth speaking of,
winding up with the quite unnecessary announcement—</p>

<p>“I’m ’Merican.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” I replied; “I knew at once you
were an American.”</p>

<p>“Yes; is that so?” said he. “Hew did ye know
that, stranger?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “by your accent, the estimate
you form of your country, and, pardon me for
saying so, but no one but an American would have
asked me such questions as you have, or manifested
such a desire to find out all about me and my affairs.”</p>

<p>He did not appear to be at all annoyed at this
remark, but merely said—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“By thunder! stranger, you are a queer coon.
Will you come and liquor?”</p>

<p>I declined with thanks, and left young America
to ponder over the inscrutable ways and manners
of the “darned Britisher.” He was evidently the
offspring of a parent who, perchance, had “struck
ile,” and had never before forsaken his ancestral
home in search of travel and adventure; and, if
such was the case, we must excuse the young man.
As soon as I left him I sought my bedroom,
chronicled the above conversation in my diary,
and retired to bed, where I slept soundly.</p>

<p>The following day I and three others formed a
party for a visit to the far-famed pyramids of Gizeh.
We chartered a carriage, taking our lunch with us;
and from the time we left Shepheard’s Hotel until
we returned that hateful word, “Backsheesh,” resounded
in our ears; indeed, I should say that there
is no word in the Egyptian language so frequently on
the tip of an Arab tongue as that. I should suppose
that the pyramids of Gizeh are about ten miles
from Cairo. There is a pretty good road, which
was constructed by the former Khedive, Ismail,
specially to accommodate the Prince of Wales when
he visited the place some years ago. During our
drive we could almost have imagined that a line of
sentries had been posted all along the road specially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to utter that horrid word, “Backsheesh,” so continuously
were our tympanums offended with it.
Arrived at the base of the Great Pyramid, we
are immediately surrounded by a considerable
number of Arabs, who are all anxious to assist
us in the ascent, of course, for a small consideration;
but one of our party having been there once
before, knew how to set about matters in a
business-like way, so he demanded at once the presence
of the Pyramid Sheik, who very soon came.
We told him we did not want all this crowd of
Arabs, but two each would be sufficient. Accordingly
he allotted us these, but as he suggested
that a third would be desirable to push us up from
behind, we had him. Those who have ascended
the Great Pyramid are not likely to forget the
dusky demons who accompany them.</p>

<p>I commence the ascent with my body-guard, who
appear now to look upon me as a piece of brittle
china, and are most anxious to prevent me using
my limbs in my own way—they will not let me
take a step without their assistance. Directly I
had started I found my body-guard considerably
augmented, and notwithstanding repeated warnings
that I did not want them, and that they would not
get any backsheesh, they stuck to me all the way
up and back. For the time being I belong solely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to these energetic, incessantly-chattering Arabs,
whose most strenuous efforts were now put forth to
damaging my ball and socket joints.</p>

<p>I have to ascend 203 steps—the lower steps are
about four feet high, and few of them less than
three feet anywhere. The two Arabs in front get
on to the step I have to land on; each seizes an arm,
one gets behind, and the hoisting process begins.
The latter gives the cue, and with a loud “Ha-hu,”
up I go from one step to the other. This game goes
on with great rapidity, until I had got about half-way
up, where I think it advisable to rest awhile.
So down I sat, but soon found that instead of three
Arabs I was at once surrounded by about a dozen,
all talking most vehemently to me at the same time.
It was in vain to protest—all had curiosities,
scarabei, little images, and ancient coins, some of
them curious, no doubt dating back to the time of
Adam. For a small consideration they were all
anxious to place these in my possession, and all
were shouting into my ear, “Autica efendi, autica.”
At last, for peace sake, I bought a small image of a
defunct Pharaoh from one, and from another three
or four copper coins, all, of course, the only genuine.
In vain I protested against having any more. I
had no peace until I had bought something from
each one; in fact, I had no quiet until I turned all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
my pockets inside out, showing conclusively that I
had spent every piaster with them. After resting
awhile, we continued the ascent, and after a succession
of ha-hus, tugs, and hoistings, I at last found
myself on the summit of the Great Pyramid, and
well rewarded for the trouble I had taken.</p>

<p>Here, in this bright, clear atmosphere, I saw
stretching out for miles on the west the Libyan
Desert, and reaching out before and around us in
vast extent the classic and historic hills, rivers, and
plains of Ham and Mizraim, Heliopolis, Memphis,
Mount Mokattam, Sakhara, the beautiful city of
Cairo, with its numberless mosques and slender
minarets, skirted by the outstretched Nile, bearing
on its placid bosom hundreds of dahabeahs, and on
its banks tall waving palm-trees. Nearer is the
village of Gizeh, and closer still the remaining
pyramids of Gizeh, the granite temple, and the
sphinx, the whole forming a picture that cannot
be effaced in a life-time.</p>

<p>It is said with some truth, “Time tries all,” but
I have also heard it said that “the pyramids try
time,” and, upon my word, it almost seems so,
when we think of their great antiquity. Here
they have stood for thousands of years in majestic
grandeur, looking down on many Pharaohs and
many dynasties, and witnessing the rise, greatness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and decline of a once mighty nation. Abraham,
Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Moses have gazed on
these huge piles of masonry, which raised their
lofty heads long, long before Abraham in a day of
famine sought bread at the hands of Pharaoh.</p>

<p>When I had spent some time in gazing again and
again on this beautiful scene, and thoroughly succeeded
in obtaining a mental photograph of it, I
commenced the descent, and found I could get
down much more comfortably without assistance
than with; but this the pertinacious Arabs would
not hear of, they said, on account of the danger to
me. But my own private opinion was that they
wanted to earn good backsheesh by persistent
attention. I resigned myself to my fate, and at
last reached the foot of the pyramid by a series of
jumps and bumps very trying to my spinal column,
and which joggled my internal economy most unpleasantly.</p>

<p>After a short rest, we explored the interior, a
rather difficult achievement in some parts. We
had brought a good substantial luncheon with us
from the hotel, which we thankfully disposed of at
a house, or palace, near by. This was specially
built, I believe, either for the Prince of Wales or
the Empress Eugenie, I really forget which. After
lunch we visited the sphinx, two or three tombs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and the other two pyramids, settled up with the
sheik, and drove off to our hotel; and not until I
reached the steps of the hotel did I hear the last of
that hateful word “Backsheesh.” When I retired
to rest I dreamt of a pocketful of large copper
coins and scarabei, an armful of defunct Pharaohs,
an army of lithe, sinewy, swarthy, impecunious
Arabs, amongst whom I had scattered a ship-load
of piasters, and “still they were not happy.”</p>

<p>Before I have done entirely with the pyramids, I
think I ought to say something about them, as
those at Gizeh are the most remarkable. This
group consists of nine, and comprises three of the
most remarkable monuments in existence—those of
Cheops, Cephren, and that of Mycerinus, the last-named
much smaller than the other two. Herodotus,
who was born about 500 B.C., tells us that
in building the great pyramid of Cheops it took
100,000 men working incessantly for 30 years to
complete it; 10 years of this 30 was spent in making
a causeway 3,000 feet long, to facilitate the transportation
of the stone from the Turah quarries.
Herodotus describes the method of building by
steps, and raising the stones from layer to layer by
machines, and finally of facing the external portion
from the top down. Its present height is 460 feet,
the original height was 480 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The extent of solid masonry has been estimated
at 82,111,000 cubic feet. It at present covers 12
acres. The only entrance is on the north face, 49
feet above the base, though the masonry has been
so much broken away that the <i lang="fr">débris</i> reaches nearly
up to it. A passage, 3 feet 11 inches high and 3
feet 5½ inches wide, conducts from the entrance
down a slope at an angle of 26° 41´, a distance of
320 feet 10 inches to the original sepulchral
chamber, commonly known as the subterraneous
apartment; it is carried, reduced in dimensions,
beyond this a distance of 52 feet 9 inches into the
rock, though for what purpose remains a matter of
conjecture. The sepulchral chamber is 46 feet long
by 27 feet wide, and 11½ feet high. From the
entrance passage another branches off and leads to
several other passages and chambers. One of the
latter, known as the <em>Queen’s Chamber</em>, is situated
about the middle of the pyramid, 67 feet above the
base; it has a groined roof, and measures 17 feet
broad by 18 feet 9 inches long and 20 feet 3 inches
high. The other, called the <em>King’s Chamber</em>, is
reached by an offshoot from the Queen’s Passage,
150 feet long. Its dimensions are 34 feet 3 inches
long by 17 feet 1 inch wide, and 19 feet 1 inch
high. The chamber is lined with red granite highly
polished, single stones reaching from the floor to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the ceiling, and the ceiling itself is formed of nine
large slabs of polished granite extending from wall
to wall. The only contents of the apartment is a
sarcophagus of red granite, which, judging by its
dimensions, must have been introduced when the
building was proceeding. It is supposed to have
contained a wooden coffin with the mummy of the
king, and that these long since disappeared when
the pyramids were first opened and plundered. We
do not see these pyramids as they originally were.
The outer casing of polished stone has been removed
and utilized in constructing the mosque of
Sultan Hassan. These pyramids were built between
5,000 and 6,000 years ago. Great was the antiquity of
Thebes before European history begins to dawn.
It was declining before the foundations of Rome
were laid, but the building of the great pyramids of
Gizeh preceded the earliest history of Thebes by
1,000 years. Whilst speaking of Thebes, I’ll just
mention that there are to be seen to-day the tomb of
the great Sethos, Joseph’s Pharaoh, of his greater
son, Rameses II., and of Menophres or Meneptha,
in whose reign the Exodus took place. In the
tomb of Sethos, coloured sculptures cover 320 feet
of the excavation. There is to be seen the
draughtsman’s handiwork in red colour, showing the
designs that were to be executed by the sculptor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and the corrections in black ink of the superintendent
of such works, and although these sketches
were made 3,000 years ago, they are still quite clear
and fresh-looking. On the east side of the pyramid,
half buried in sand, is the wonderful colossal
Sphinx, his head 25 feet high and back 100 feet
long, all one stone.</p>

<p>My next visit was to Heliopolis on donkey-back. I
was told that it would be a nice ride, but nothing
to see except an obelisk when I got there. Notwithstanding
this, I felt very desirous of visiting
this ancient seat of learning, where Moses had lived
and “become learned in all the wisdom of the
Egyptians.” Accordingly Ibrahim and I started
off. Leaving the citadel and tombs of the Caliphs
on my right, I had a pleasant ride of about two
hours or so from Cairo through avenues of acacias
and tamarisk trees, a large plain covered with a
luxuriant growth of sugar-cane, citrons, lemons,
oranges, ricinus, cactuses, olive trees and palms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Before reaching the mounds of Heliopolis is a well
of fine water on the border of a grove of citrons
and palms, and in the midst of these is a venerable
old sycamore enclosed by palisades and regarded
with veneration by the Copts, as the place where
Joseph, Mary and the infant Saviour rested on their
flight into Egypt. Although a very aged tree, it
cannot be, of course, as old as the legend affirms.
It is, however, a very pretty spot, sheltered from
the busy hum of life, embowered in citron thickets,
which resound with the music of birds, and with
tall, waving palm trees, on the trembling branches of
which large vultures rock to and fro. I approach
the site of Heliopolis on a dead level, and find that it
stood formerly on an artificial elevation, overlooking
lakes which were fed by canals communicating with
the Nile. With what history does this place teem!
Here, or in the vicinity, Jeremiah wrote his Lamentations.
Thales, Solon, Pythagoras and Plato studied
here. From the learned priests of Heliopolis, Plato—who
studied here for several years—is believed
to have derived the doctrine of the immortality of the
soul and of a future state of rewards and punishments.
This neighbourhood was probably the scene
of the Exodus of the Israelites, and here was the
most celebrated university in the world for philosophy
and science. It was here that Potipherah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the priest or Prince of On, resided. Here Joseph
married his daughter Asenath, who became the
mother of Ephraim and Manasseh. Now what do I
see? This once famous city of the sun, the
Heliopolis of Herodotus and Strabo, the On of
Joseph, the Bethshemesh of Jeremiah, the university
of the world at that time, with its collection of
colleges and temples, avenues of sphinxes and extensive
dwellings of the learned priests, dazzling
palaces, obelisks and splendid edifices has been
almost blotted out, and as I stood there absorbed in
thought, and feebly endeavouring to picture to
myself this place as it once stood, teeming with life,
wealth and power, those beautiful words of Shakespeare,
our immortal bard, came floating through
my mind as very descriptive of what I now saw—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The cloud-capt towers,</div>
<div class="verse">The gorgeous palaces,</div>
<div class="verse">The solemn temples,</div>

<div class="verse">Shall dissolve,</div>
<div class="verse">And like the baseless fabric of a vision,</div>
<div class="verse">Leave not a wreck behind.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">All was now desolation, if I except the massive
foundations of the Temple of the Sun, which are
still visible in a few places. The one solitary object
that serves to mark this once celebrated city is an
obelisk of solid granite, 62 feet high, the last monument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
of a temple that once vied in magnificence
with those of Karnak or Baalbeck, and which has
been pointing to the sky from the time of the old
monarchy for more than 4,000 years. It bears the
name of Osirtesen I. (Joseph’s contemporary), the
first great name in Theban history, builder of the
older and smaller part of the great temple of Karnak
and King of Upper and Lower Egypt, and probably
where I then stood looking at, but unable to
decipher the hieroglyphics on this obelisk, Joseph
and Moses (who had both been admitted to the
priest cast) had stood before me. <i lang="la">Sic transit gloria
mundi.</i></p>

<p>I had now seen all there was to see, and was
pleased that I had made this visit, so I mounted my
donkey and got back to Cairo. It happened to be
Friday, the Mahomedan Sunday. On this day all
the rank and fashion can be seen between four and
six driving up and down the Shoubra Road. This is
lined by a splendid avenue of trees, which meet over-head,
thus forming a delightful shade. It was now
about 4 p.m.; I performed a hasty toilet and set
off for a carriage drive down this road. I found it
thronged with visitors and a goodly sprinkling of
officers, amongst whom I saw the now famous Arabi
Pacha. Mounted sentries also were posted at intervals
each side of the road as the Khedive usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
takes a drive there every Friday about 4 or 5 p.m.
I had not been there long ere he came sweeping
down with his escort.</p>

<p>Next day I devoted to exploring the ancient (probably
the most ancient city in the world), Memphis,
the Noph of the Bible, and its necropolis, Sakhara.
According to Herodotus its foundation was ascribed
to Menes, the first King of Egypt. If this was so it
would be about 6,000 years old, and it is said that
the art of building was known centuries before his
time.</p>

<p>It is quite a good day’s work to perform this
journey in the blazing sun. I get an early breakfast
and leave at 7.30 on my donkey, accompanied
by Ibrahim on another donkey, in possession of
my luncheon. The distance to the railway station
is about two miles. Here I procure tickets for ourselves
and the two donkeys, proceed to Bedrashyn,
a distance of about ten miles, then remount and
pass through the village of Mitrahenny, then a very
fine palm-grove, on to the site of ancient Memphis,
once a large, rich, and splendid city, remarkable for
its temples and palaces. As late as 524 B.C., at
the time of the conquest of Cambyses it was the
chief commercial centre of the country, and was
connected by canals with the Lakes Mœris and
Mareotis. Some distance from the village of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Mitrahenny I saw near the pathway a colossal
statue of Rameses the Great in excellent preservation.
It is composed of a single block of red granite,
polished. It was originally 50 feet in length, but
has been mutilated, and now does not measure more
than 48 feet. It lies on its side in a pit by the wayside,
which, during the inundation of the Nile, is
filled with water. On its subsidence the alluvial
deposit is scraped off sufficiently to show the statue
to travellers. Vast mounds of broken pottery and
statuary are to be seen about here and Sakhara,
probably burying the ancient city. Sakhara is
about two miles or so from Memphis, and the
greater part of the ride lies through sandy desert.
It lies, in fact, on the edge of the Lybian Desert.
It is remarkable for its ancient monuments, among
which are 30 pyramids. The great step pyramid
is said to be even older than the pyramids of Gizeh.
Besides these 30 there are the ruins of a great
many others, and numberless grottoes, sarcophagi,
the Ibis catacombs, and Apis Mausoleum, which was
discovered by Mariette Bey. He observed the
head of a sphinx protruding from the sand, and
remembering that Strabo described the Serapeum
of Memphis as approached by an avenue of
sphinxes, he at once commenced his explorations
in search of the temple in which Apis was worshipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
when alive and the tomb in which it was
buried when dead. The sand-drift, after immense
exertions, was cleared away, and the avenue was
laid bare from a superincumbent mass, which was
in some places 70 feet deep. Conceive, if you can,
the splendour of this imposing approach; no less
than 141 sphinxes were discovered <i lang="la">in situ</i>, besides
the pedestals of others. The temple to which they
led has disappeared, but the tomb remains.</p>

<p>I go down hill, nearly up to my knees in sand,
with my guide. A great door is unlocked and
thrown open, we then light our candles and explore.
We proceed a considerable distance through a passage
or tunnel, and then find ourselves in a large
vault or tunnel some 200 or 300 yards in length.
Chambers lead out of it on either side as large
as an ordinary sitting-room, and about 12 feet
high, in each of which is a ponderous granite
sarcophagus, polished. Placed on the sarcophagus
like a lid was a granite slab of great size and
weight, the whole weighing about 20 tons. Near
the subterranean cemetery of the bulls are the
groves or pits of the sacred Ibis also formerly
worshipped. These are enclosed in earthenware
vases; the bones and broken urns now lie scattered
all around. These huge blocks of granite were
actually transported from the quarries near Syene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to Memphis, a distance of nearly 600 miles! I carefully
examined one sarcophagus containing the
embalmed dead deity. It was carved all over with
sacred hieroglyphics, sharp and clear in their outlines,
and the polish on the marble bright as it was
3,000 years ago. I saw between 30 and 40 of these
sarcophagi here.</p>

<p>The worship of the bull Apis was celebrated with
great pomp and splendour, and he was regarded as
the representative of Osiris.</p>

<p>His interment would cost as much as that of any
king or conqueror. It was necessary that he should
be black with a triangle of white on the forehead, a
white spot in the form of a crescent on the right
side, and a sort of knot like a beetle under his
tongue. When a bull of this description was found
he was fed four months, in a building facing the
east. At the new moon he was led to a splendid
ship with great solemnity and conveyed to Heliopolis,
where he was fed 40 days more by priests and
women, who performed before him various indecent
ceremonies. After this no one was suffered to
approach him. From Heliopolis the priests carried
him to Memphis, where he had a temple, two
chapels to dwell in, and a large court for exercise.
He had a prophetic power which he imparted to the
children about him. The omen was good or bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
according as he went into one stable or the other.
His birthday was celebrated every year when the
Nile began to rise; the festival continued seven
days. A golden patera was thrown into the Nile,
and it was said that the crocodile was tame as long
as the feast continued. He was only suffered to
live 25 years, and at his death he was embalmed
and buried in these sarcophagi amidst universal
mourning till the priest had found a successor.</p>

<p>When I emerged once more from this mausoleum
and struggled up through the sand I paid a visit to
the tomb of King Phty or Phta, said to be 5,400
years old. His sarcophagus is similar to those I
had just visited, and is contained in a nice lofty
room, the walls of which, as are the walls of the
chapel outside, plentifully and excellently sculptured,
and quite fresh in appearance, though so
ancient. I do not remember all I saw represented
on the walls and tombs, but amongst other things
there were lions, giraffes, ostriches, sacred Ibis,
owls, crocodiles, elephants, buffaloes, a boat floating
on the water with a man in it, and in the water fish
of different kinds, Egyptians fishing, harpooning
the hippopotamus, agricultural pursuits, ploughing
and sowing, treading out the corn just as they do
now, the butcher sharpening his knife, the butcher
killing the animal whilst another holds him down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
hunting, battle scenes, &amp;c., &amp;c. Some figures on
the wall had been painted red; the paint is still good
and not at all frayed. In another excavation, after
leaving this tomb, I saw a mummy; but I must not
expend too much time over this place, although I
feel quite disposed to keep on talking of it. We
cannot leave the plain of Memphis without recurring
to the most memorable event in all its eventful
history. It was probably here that Moses and
Aaron stood before Pharaoh and demanded that he
should let the people go. This was the spot where
“Pharaoh rose up in the night, he and all his
servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a
great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house in
which there was not one dead.”</p>

<p>Ruminating on the mutability of human affairs,
I mounted my donkey, had a long ride through
beautiful palm groves, and finally emerged from
the village of Gizeh on to the main road from the
pyramids and over a handsome bridge across the
Nile to my hotel. When half-way across the Nile,
I observed the Khedive and his escort coming
along, so I got off my donkey to watch him pass.
I took off my hat to him, and he acknowledged my
salutation with a gracious bow. As I returned
homewards, in imagination I saw these glorious
cities of old Egypt peopled. I tried to picture to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
myself—feebly, I dare say—the splendour and wealth
of those people, the magnificence of the designs
carried out, the result of which was that neither
before nor since has the sun shone on anything like
such superb, massive, and imposing temples, palaces,
and tombs in the world. Thebes, with its hundred
gates, was perhaps the most splendid city in the
world for many centuries. Then there were Luxor,
Karnak, Philæ, Elephantine, Baalbeck, Dendera,
Aba-Simbal, Abydos, Esneh, Edfau, Silsilis, and
other places, all decorated with palaces, temples,
pyramids, tombs, and sphinxes, &amp;c., on the same
magnificent scale; but all have shared the same fate,
and their stupendous ruins are all that remain to
strike the stranger with awe and wonder.</p>

<p>About two days after our arrival in Cairo, our
party was augmented by the arrival of Mr. W. D.
James, Mr. A. James, and Mr. Percy Aylmer,
Mahoom, a black boy; who had been rescued from
the Soudan some years beforehand; Jules, George,
and Anselmia, the three latter European servants.
Here we engaged Suleiman as a sort of general
manager for the caravan; he had travelled through
the Soudan with Sir Samuel Baker; Ali, a very
good cook, and Cheriffe, who made a very good
butler, and had been accustomed to travel as a kind
of steward on the Nile boats.</p>

<p>Our next move was on to Suez by rail, a day’s
journey through another very interesting portion of
Egypt, the land of Goshen, the home of the
Israelites for 430 years. A good deal of country
near the line of railway is now under good cultivation,
supplied by the Sweet Water Canal. The
earliest attempt that we are acquainted with to construct
a canal was by Rameses the Great. It was
between 50 and 60 miles in length, and left the Nile
at Bubastis, reaching into the neighbourhood of
Lake Timsah. Upon it Rameses built his two
treasure cities, Pithom and Raamses near Ismailia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
mentioned in the 1st chapter of Exodus, and there
is little doubt that the Israelites, who were then in
bondage, laboured at these cities, and the canal 3,000
years ago. It is probable also that the canal dated
far back beyond this time, for the Egyptians had
been great in canal making 1,000 years or more
before then. One of the greatest marks of Rameses
was the covering the whole of Egypt with a net-work
of waterways in connection with the river. They
served a double purpose—they greatly extended the
supply of water and the area of cultivation, and
were invaluable for defensive purposes. Many
centuries after this Pharaoh Necho took this canal
in hand 500 or 600 years B.C. He undertook to
adapt it for navigation and prolong it to the head
of the Arabian Gulf. He is the only Egyptian
monarch whose name appears connected with maritime
enterprise, and he was so zealous as to perfect
the formation of a ship canal connecting the Nile
with the Red Sea. He carried the great work as far
as the Bitter Lakes, and then abandoned it, warned
by an oracle to desist, after expending the lives of
120,000 fellahs. Herodotus actually <em>saw</em> the docks,
which as a part of the plan, he had constructed on
the Red Sea. One conqueror succeeded another,
and the works got neglected and the canal choked
up. The Romans again carried on extensive repairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and alterations, but on the downfall of the Roman
Empire anarchy and confusion prevailed, and all
public works were allowed to fall into dilapidation.
The canals were choked up, and remained unnavigable
till the Arab conquest of Egypt. Under the
vigorous administration of Amrou they were re-opened,
and corn and other provisions were conveyed
along them for the use of Mecca, Medina, and
other Arabian towns. A very great deal could be
said about their ancient canals, but I have only time
to glance <i lang="fr">en passant</i> at a little of the ancient history
of the places I passed by. In the evening we
arrived at Suez, 76 miles east of Cairo. There is
very little to interest or amuse at Suez, but here we
were obliged to remain for nearly a week by reason
of stoppages in the canal, which are frequent. The
day after our arrival we took donkey rides down the
Mole, which is 850 yards long, to see after our provisions,
tents, &amp;c., which Mr. James and his friends
had got together for our campaigning in the
Soudan. We found them, and there sure enough
was a stambouk (a native boat something like a
fishing smack) not only full but piled up with everything
that we could possibly require, and the collecting
of which must have necessitated a great deal
of forethought. Two days after our arrival, Mr.
J. B. Colvin, of Monkham’s Hall, Waltham Abbey,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
arrived by steamer from Australia, to join us, thus
completing the party. During our stay here there
happened to be an eclipse of the moon. This
appeared to have a very disturbing influence on the
native element, as I should think that every tom-tom
in Suez was called into requisition and incessantly
beaten all over the town during the eclipse to
drive away the evil spirits. If it did not succeed I
have no hesitation in saying that all the good spirits
(ourselves) would very soon have vanished if we
could. We had ample time to explore the town
both by day and night, and amuse ourselves as well
as we could by donkey rides down the Mole, boating,
fishing and bathing, but whilst bathing we were
careful not to go far from shore for a header or remain
in long, as sharks are so plentiful in the Red
Sea. One evening, two or three of us were wandering
about at night and heard strange noises issuing
from a small building. We were sufficiently inquisitive
to go up a narrow passage to ascertain the
cause. There we found about a dozen very dirty
howling dervishes in the odour of sanctity (a
decidedly strong odour we thought) performing
their senseless and absurd mode of worship with
great energy. They were in a dirty room, having a
damp, uneven, earthen floor, the dimensions of which
were about 7 feet high, 7 feet wide, and perhaps 10<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
feet long. Very little light or air could find its way
in. The weather was very hot, and the sudoriferous
glands of these unsavoury gentry were in an
abnormal state of activity. Need I say that we
remained here a very short time? We were all
thoroughly tired of Suez, and anxious to get on to
Souâkin, but unfortunately, amongst all the
steamers blocked in the Suez Canal, we could not
hear of a single one bound for Souâkin. The <i>Agra</i>,
a British India steamer, was bound for Jeddah, on
the opposite coast, so Mr. James telegraphed to
London, asking the Company to let us be taken to
Souâkin. They acceded to the request. Accordingly,
on the 8th December, we got on board, unloaded the
stambouk, and started off for Souâkin, <em>the</em> port of
Nubia, and indeed of Central Africa, since made historical
by our slaughter of thousands of Arabs in that
neighbourhood. The places of interest pointed out
to us on the Red Sea coast were Moses’ Well, Mount
Sinai, and the spot where the Israelites crossed.
Here the arm of the sea is 12 miles wide, and just
here Pi-hahiroth before Baal-zephon is the one and
only opening in the mountains. Here one million
and a half of the Israelites—men, women, and
children—passed through in the night, whilst the
army of Egypt pursued them. After a most
agreeable but very warm voyage (90° F. in the
shade) of 3½ days we reached Souâkin. During
our last day at sea Captain Smith was very careful
in his navigation, as the Red Sea, particularly
in that last day’s voyage, abounds in coral-reefs.</p>

</div>

<p>We were now just about to land in the Soudan, and
as that word is, as I am writing, in everyone’s
mouth, it would be as well to say something about
it before I go any further.</p>

<p>The Soudan, or Beled-es-Sudan, Land of the
Blacks, has since the Middle Ages been the common
name of the vast extent of country in Central Africa,
which stretches southward from the Desert of Sahara
to the Equator. The name was originally applied
by the Arabs, but with great latitude of signification,
different authors giving it to the different
parts of the territory with which the varying routes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
across the desert made them acquainted. Later
geographers divide it into High and Low Soudan.
Many include Senegambia in it. High Soudan
stretches from the sources of the Niger, Senegal
and Gambia, to the Upper Nile, or, at all events, to
the south of Lake Chad, and embraces the mountains
of Kong and of Upper Senegambia, the
kingdoms of Ashantee, Dahomey, Mandingo,
Houssah, and Feelah. All this country is richly
watered and wooded, distinguished by a luxuriant
tropical vegetation and by deposits of gold. Low
Soudan stretches on the north of High Soudan,
eastward to Kordofan, and northward to the
desert. This district is partly level, partly undulating,
and partly broken by chains of lofty hills
rising within its own limits. Its situation between
the desert on the north and the mountains which
border it on the south, with a climate destructive
to foreigners, and a lawless and predatory population,
make it one of the most inaccessible regions
in the world. In the south, where it is watered by
the Niger, Lake Tchad, and their tributaries, it
assumes a fertile and cultivated appearance. The
inhabitants contain numerous nations of different
races, chiefly of the Negro, Fulde, or Fellatah stems,
together with many Arab colonists.</p>

<p>This is what Sir Samuel Baker says about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Soudan in the <cite>Contemporary Review</cite>: “Before the
White Nile annexation the Soudan was accepted as
a vague and unsatisfactory definition as representing
everything south of the first cataract at Assouan,
without any actual limitation; but the extension of
Egyptian territory to the Equator has increased
the value of the term, and the word Soudan now
embraces the whole of that vast region which comprises
the Deserts of Libya, the ancient Merve,
Dongola, Kordofan, Darfur, Senaar, and the entire
Nile Basin, bordered on the east by Abyssinia, and
elsewhere by doubtful frontiers. The Red Sea
alone confines the Egyptian limit to an unquestionable
line. Wherever the rainfall is regular the
country is immensely fertile; therefore the Soudan
may be divided into two portions—the great deserts
which are beyond the rainy zone, and consequently
arid, and the southern provinces within that zone,
which are capable of great agricultural development.
Including the levels of the mighty Nile, a distance
is traversed of about 3,300 miles from the Victoria
N’yanza to the Mediterranean; the whole of this
region throughout its passage is now included in the
name ‘Soudan.’”</p>

<p>We had on board Captain Gascoigne and Dr.
Melidew, of the Royal Horse Guards. They were
also bent on a shooting expedition in the Soudan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
but did not accompany us farther than Souâkin.
There were several other passengers on board bound
for India.</p>

<p>We landed at Souâkin on the quay, in a large open
square. One side is occupied by what is absurdly
called the palace, a large building in which the
Governor transacts his official duties, the opposite
side by the custom-house, the other by a guard-house,
whilst the opposite side was not occupied by
any building, but was open to and contiguous to the
Red Sea; it was, in fact, the quay.</p>

<p>Here I saw nine tons of elephants’ tusks ready
for shipment. The average weight of each pair of
tusks would be somewhere about 36lbs. I computed
that about 560 elephants would have been
slaughtered to make up nine tons of ivory; and if
elephants are killed at that rate, people may well
exclaim about the scarcity of ivory. What next
attracted my attention was about 60 Bedouin Arabs
in heavy chains, wandering about in this large open
square. These poor fellows had to pay their gaolers
100 dollars a month. The Maria Theresa dollar
which is in use in the Soudan, and preferred to any
other coin, is worth 4s. of our money. They had to
find their own food, or rather their tribe did so. I
was told that at one time they were a strong tribe,
and had come over from Arabia. They had at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
time 8,000 camels, but they had dwindled down to
2,000, as whenever they failed to pay the taxes some
of their camels were seized. I cannot speak with
any certainty of their offence, but somehow or other
they had incurred the anger of the then Governor of
the Soudan, Ali Riza Pacha, about a year beforehand.
He clapped them into irons, and there they
seemed likely to remain, unless some more kindly-disposed
Governor superseded him. This fortunately
happened not long before our return to
Souâkin in the following April, when Ali Dheen
Pacha was appointed, who soon liberated them.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Souâkin are principally Arabs,
a few Greek and Italian merchants, and two Englishmen.
The Government usually have a garrison of
about 300 Nubian troops stationed in an undefended
barrack on the mainland, about a mile from the
town.</p>

<p>Blind to their own interest, the Egyptian Government
obstructs traffic by the heavy duties which it
levies. Cattle and sheep, which can be obtained
from the tribes in the neighbourhood, are sent by
hundreds annually to Suez by sea. Were it not
for the heavy duties imposed, I should say that a
large trade ought to be done with Suez, which is
but three and a half days from Souâkin. There is
a telegraph line to Kassala. They have large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
numbers of camels for sale or hire, but no horses,
mules, or donkeys. The water is collected during
the wet season in a large reservoir about a mile
from the town; there are also two or three wells at
the same place.</p>

<p>We soon introduced ourselves to Mr. Brewster,
an Englishman, and head of the custom-house; and
he in turn sent for Achmet Effendi, the Civil
Governor of Souâkin, to whom he introduced us.
Of course, there followed the inevitable salaaming,
coffee and cigarettes, so customary in the East.
Our business was very soon explained; we wanted
about 80 camels provided without delay to transport
ourselves and our baggage across the desert to
Kassala. The camel sheik, Moussa, was sent for,
and soon appeared—a really picturesque, handsome-featured
man, almost black, possessed of
gleaming, regular teeth, wearing a snow-white
turban and loose white robe, precisely like the
ancient Roman toga. <i lang="fr">En passant</i>, I cannot help
thinking that the slang word “togs” is derived
from the word toga.</p>

<p>The Sheik Moussa promised to provide us with
the camels within three days; and, strange to say,
he did so, a singular instance of a man keeping his
word to one in the East. I know that my experience
amongst the officials in Turkey was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
different—there everything was put off until to-morrow.
A day would be fixed for me to call at
the Seraskierat, or War Office, and when I went I
was usually met with the reply, “Yarrin sabbah,
effendi” (to-morrow, sir), or “Ywash, ywash”
(by and bye), not once or twice, but I daresay five
or six times. Another inconvenient phrase which
is always on their lips if one wants any money from
them, and which is spoken trippingly on the tongue,
is “Para yok” (no paras), in English, “I haven’t a
farthing.”</p>

<p>It soon became known that there was a “Hakeem
Ingelese,” as they called me, in our party, and I
very soon had many patients, amongst whom was a
child of one of the Bedouin Arabs.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I improved my acquaintance
with Mr. Brewster, who had officially resided here
four years, and, of course, knew most of the people
and the customs of the place. There are a great
many good and curiously-built houses with flat
roofs, built of blocks of white coral, and a great
many tent-like structures constructed with reeds,
stalks of palm leaves, and matting, which is very
cheap and abundant, made by the natives out of
palm leaves. Mr. Brewster was good enough to
escort me over Souâkin, and give me all the information
he could about the place and people. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
we strolled on he pointed out the home of a slave-dealer,
who then had several slaves—children and
young girls. These could easily be transferred as
ivory, dhurra, or something of the kind, as old
Achmet Effendi connived at slave-dealing, and
would shut his eyes to the transaction provided his
palm was crossed with a couple of dollars per head.
The little children realize from 30 to 40 dollars a
head, and young girls 70, 80, or 100 dollars.</p>

<p>“Why,” said I, “in England it is supposed that
the slave trade has been abolished in Egypt long
ago. When in Cairo I saw the slave-market, but
was told no slaves have been sold there for the
past three or four year.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” said he, “you will find, when you get further
into Africa, that it is still carried on, and more openly
than it is here. When they have been captured they
are driven across the desert just like cattle to some
quiet place on the Red Sea coast, where there is a
stambouk waiting; there shipped and taken across to
Jeddah in a day or so, and sold by public auction.”
The only other Englishman resident at Souâkin was
Mr. Bewlay; he had at once lived in Jeddah for a
time, and he assured me that he had often seen slaves
sold there. <i lang="fr">Apropos</i> of my profession, Mr. Brewster
related a very interesting, and, to me, a very instructive
anecdote, which served to enlighten me considerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
as to the peculiar line of thought which sometimes
permeates the native brain, and to the still
more peculiar line of action which it leads to. He
told me that about three years or so before our
arrival a German doctor, who had settled there,
whilst attending a native, had occasion to perform
some trivial operation which was not attended with
the success which he desired or anticipated, as unfortunately
for the native, and subsequently for the
doctor, the former was so inconsiderate as to expire
a day or two afterwards. The doctor could truly
say after this, “A doctor’s lot is not a happy one,”
inasmuch as the friends of the defunct Arab paid him
a visit, and in a marked but highly objectionable
manner, showed what they thought of the doctor’s
services in a way that did not commend itself to me,
and which, for want of a better illustration, we will
call “a new way of paying old debts.” The worthy
leech was requested, in so pressing a manner that
refusal was out of the question, to accompany these
friends of the deceased, and <i lang="la">nolens volens</i>, they
escorted him to a large open space just outside the
town, where dhurra and other things were sold, and
there they remunerated him, not in dhurra, not in
sheep, not in goats, not even in money, but in a most
cutting manner, for they fell upon him with their
knives and literally chopped him to pieces. Reader,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
“would you be surprised to hear,” that on learning
this I was extremely careful not to perform any rash
operations, and that my ministrations to the lame,
the halt, the sick, and the blind, should be successful.
At all events, it is a source of great gratification
to me that they were not so unsuccessful as to
necessitate the sudden and unlooked-for departure
of any of my patients to their happy hunting-grounds.</p>

<p>The Hadendowah Arabs are the most numerous
tribe in the neighbourhood of Souâkin, and are, for
the most part, good-looking men; they are very
dark, approaching to blackness, have good, well-formed
features, large dark eyes, arched black eyebrows,
and face, on which as a rule there is little or
no hair, and nearly every Arab, here and elsewhere,
that I met with, is possessed of the most beautifully
white, regular, and sound teeth possible.
There is little doubt but that this is due to the
simple manner in which they live; their chief food is
dhurra (sorghum vulgare). This contains 11½ per
cent. of gluten, our wheat only ten per cent. This
is the wheat of Egypt, and is the food of camels,
horses, and men. Camels, however, get very little
of it, as a rule, unless on a forced march, or are
owned by a man who can afford it. It grows to the
height of nine or ten feet, and is very prolific. I
never counted the seeds in a head of this sorghum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
but Sir Samuel Baker did, and he says that in one
single head he found 4,840 grains. The Arabs,
speaking generally, are not big-boned men, but are
lithe, active, and sinewy. Their hair is bushy, frizzly,
long, and black, which they wear very curiously; they
often take as much trouble with it as any West-end
dandy would do. A parting is made around the
crown from one temple to the other; the hair on the
top is combed up and kept short—perhaps an inch
long—the rest is combed down, and stands out in a
bush all round the head to a distance of three or
four inches; a thin piece of stick, like a skewer
slightly bent towards the sharp point, is stuck
through the hair at the top, and is often used to stir
up the population, which is no doubt very numerous.
I have often seen their hair white with fat, which
they plaster on most abundantly when they can get
it, and as few wear any covering over their shoulders
when they are exposed to the heat of the blazing
sun, this drips down on to them. They wear a
bundle of charms secured just above the elbow, a
tope, or loin-cloth round the waist, which reaches
down to their knees, and very many a ring in one
nostril. Nearly all of them carry a shield and a
long spear weighted at one end. The Hadendowhas
are much given to lying and laziness.</p>

<p>During the time that we remained here we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
fully occupied in preparing for our journey across
the desert from Souâkin to Kassala, a distance of
about 280 miles; we cut up old boxes, made new
ones, and sorted out what provisions, &amp;c., we should
require. I arranged my medicine-chest and surgical
instruments so that I could get at what I might want
easily. We got a little shooting, sand-grouse, flamingoes,
pelicans, and herons; wandered about the town
and frightened all the children in the place, who
thought we were slave-dealers come to steal them.
The principal slave supply is obtained from the White
Nile and Darfour; Khartoum, I believe, is the principal
slave mart.</p>

<p>At nights we stretched ourselves out on the divan
that ran round the room in the palace, and slept head
to feet all round. This room adjoined and looked out
on the square in which the Bedouin prisoners were
confined; frequently in the early morning they woke
us up with their clanking chains, or by indulging in
their peculiar mode of devotion. The day before we
started on our journey, Mr. Brewster said—</p>

<p>“Well, Doctor, I hope you will all return alive
and well, and not be so unfortunate as a party that
Dr. Felkin accompanied a year or two ago.”</p>

<p>“I am sure I quite indulge in the hope of returning
to England in a sound state,” I replied. “But tell
me about the misfortunes of the party you speak of.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is done in a very few words,” said he. “Six
missionaries went from Souâkin and six from Zanzibar,
meeting eventually in the wilds of Africa, sent
out by the English Church Mission Society, to reclaim
lost sheep. They were not happy in the selection of
a suitable spot for evangelising, as only three of
them and Dr. Felkin returned to Souâkin, looking
considerably the worse for wear; the others had
succumbed to fever, dysentery, and spears. Indeed,
I am not quite sure that some of them were not
eaten.”</p>

<div class="chapsub">

<p>THE START ACROSS THE DESERT—MY CAMEL SERVES ME A
SCURVY TRICK—THE CAMEL, ITS HABITS AND TRAINING.</p>

</div>

<p>Three days after our arrival at Souâkin there were
some very heavy showers of rain. Mr. Brewster informed
me that it was eighteen months since it last
rained there.</p>

<p>On the fourth day after our arrival about 80 hired
camels were brought into the large open square to
be laden with the tents and baggage of every description.
I wish I could adequately describe the scene
that ensued—the camels groan and bellow without
any provocation, as if they were the most ill-used
animals in existence; the Arabs shout and wrangle
with each other as they adjust the loads on the
haweias (a kind of pack-saddle), clutch one another
by the hair of the head, after the manner of women
when quarrelling, and shake the offending head about
most vigorously. Our head-man, Suleiman, walks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
round and distributes his favours very impartially—a
tug of the hair for one, a box on the ears for
another, and a flick of the coorbatch (a whip made
of hippopotamus hide) for another. This scene
lasted for about three hours, and when at last they
did start, they formed a very long hamlah, or caravan.
The head of one camel is tied to the tail of
the one in front, a long piece of rope intervening to
allow for the long stride of the camel. We posted
our letters—the last for some time to come—for
England, to say that we were just starting on our
Arab life across the Nubian desert. The caravan
having started, each of us sees to his riding camel
being got ready. We are some time in starting,
getting our makloufas (camel saddles) properly and
securely adjusted, and our little belongings, such as
rifles, revolvers, saddle-bags, travelling satchels, &amp;c.,
fixed on them. Each one has a zanzimeer hung on
to a strap by the side of the camel. The word zanzimeer
requires explanation; it is a large leathern
bottle, capable of holding three or four quarts of
water. As, in our journey across the desert, we
should perhaps be sometimes two or three days
before we came to any well, we had to provide a
water-camel, whose business was to carry two large
barrels full of water for domestic purposes. Each of
these had a padlock on them, so that the Arabs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
could not get at them just whenever they felt
inclined—a very necessary precaution, as they
are so very careless, would take the spigot out
of the barrel, quench their thirst, and as likely
as not insecurely replace the plug, and let the
water waste, which would be a very serious calamity.
The mode of mounting and sitting on a
camel is peculiar; my legs don’t hang down each
side of him in stirrups, but hang down in front of
the saddle each side of his neck or crossed over the
neck. No stirrups are used. The camel, of course,
is on the ground, with his legs tucked under him; I
approach his side and give a sudden vault or spring
on to the makloufa. This must be done with great
dexterity and quickness, unless the attendant has
one foot placed on his fore-leg, as the camel gets up
<em>instantly</em> as soon as I leave the ground, so of course,
unless I am quick and dexterous, the result is disasterous;
in other words, the camel gets on to his
legs, and I go off mine on to my back. I watched
the process of mounting very carefully, as it was my
first experience of camel riding. I attempted and
succeeded in doing the same as my pattern, and
when my camel got up (which he did pretty quickly,
and not without considerable danger and inconvenience
to me), I felt that I occupied a very high
and somewhat precarious position. However, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
soon got accustomed to the peculiar motion of a camel.
A hygeen, dromedary, or riding camel, can go on a
shuffling kind of trot (which is infinitely preferable
to a fast trot or walk) at the rate of about five
miles an hour, and I am sure that anyone who rides
25 or 28 miles a day, under the burning rays of an
African sun, will think he has done quite enough,
although on some occasions we have made forced
marches and travelled 30 or 33 miles in one day.
There were no hygeens at Souâkin; we therefore
rode our caravan camels. A hamlah, or caravan
camel, is capable of carrying considerably over 3
cwt. for very long distances, travels at the rate of
2½ miles per hour, and will go steadily on for 12,
14, or 16 hours without stopping to eat or drink.
He only requires water every fourth day, and can go
without (on a pinch) 5 or 6 days, but when he does
drink it is as well to let out his girths a few inches,
or he will burst them. The twigs and leaves of the
mimosa and kittar bushes, the scanty herbage of
the desert, is all he requires, except whilst making
forced marches, when he requires a certain amount
of dhurra, because he has no time for grazing. This
useful animal may well be called the ship of the
desert, for if it were not for him, the enormous
extent of burning sand which separates the fertile
portion of the Soudan from Lower Egypt would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
like an ocean devoid of vessels, and the deserts
would be a barrier absolutely impassable by man.
During the season when fresh pasture is abundant
camels can go for weeks without water, provided
they are not loaded or required to make extraordinary
exertions; the juices of the plants which
form their food are then sufficient to quench their
thirst. The flesh of the young animal is one of the
greatest luxuries; of the skins tents are made; the
various sorts of hair or wool shed by the camel are
wrought into different fabrics; and its dried dung
constitutes excellent fuel, the only kind, indeed, to
be obtained throughout vast extents of country.
In order to qualify camels for great exertions and
the endurance of fatigue, the Arabs begin to educate
them at an early age. They are first taught to bear
burdens by having their limbs secured under their
belly, and then a weight proportioned to their
strength is put on; this is not changed for a heavier
load till the animal is thought to have gained sufficient
power to sustain it. Food and drink are not
allowed at will, but given in small quantity, at long
intervals. They are then gradually accustomed to
long journeys and an accelerated pace until their
qualities of fleetness and strength are fully brought
into action. They are taught to kneel, for the purpose
of receiving or removing their load. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
too heavily laden they refuse to rise, and by loud
cries complain of the injustice. Those which are
used for speed alone are capable of travelling from
60 to 90 miles a day: Instead of employing blows
or ill-treatment to increase their speed, the camel-drivers
sing cheerful songs, and thus urge the
animals to their best efforts. When a caravan of
camels arrives at a resting or halting-place, they
kneel, and the cords sustaining the loads being
untied, the bales slip down on each side. They
generally sleep on their bellies: In an abundant
pasture they generally browse as much in an hour as
serves them for ruminating all night, and for their
support during the next day. But it is uncommon
to find such pasturage, and they are contented with
the coarsest fare, and even prefer it to more delicate
plants. Breeding and milk-giving camels are
exempted from service, and fed as well as possible,
the value of their milk being greater than that of
their labour. The milk is very thick, abundant, and
rich, but of rather a strong taste. Mingled with
water it forms a very nutritive article of diet. The
young camel usually sucks for twelve months, but
such as are intended for speed are allowed to suck
and exempted from restraint for two or three years.
The camel attains the full exercise of its functions
within four or five years, and the duration of its life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
is from forty to fifty years. The hump or humps
on the back of a camel are mere accumulations of
cellular substance and fat, covered by skin and a
longer hair than that on the general surface.
During long journeys, in which the animals suffer
severely from want of food, and become greatly
emaciated, these protuberances become gradually
absorbed, and no trace of them left, except that the
skin is loose and flabby where they were situated.
In preparing for a journey, it is necessary to guard
the humps from pressure or friction by appropriate
saddles, as the slightest ulceration of these parts is
followed by the worst consequences: insects deposit
their larvæ in the sores, and sometimes extensive
and destructive mortification ensues. I have often
seen crows pecking away at sores on a camel’s side,
and was surprised to see how little notice it takes of
them. After all, I must say of the camel, that he
not only groans and roars when he is too heavily
laden, but at all times without the least occasion,
and although it may appear mild, docile, and patient,
it is frequently perverse and stupid. The males especially
are at certain times dangerous. It is sure-footed,
too, as I have often experienced in travelling
over mountains so precipitous that no animal but a
camel could have carried such heavy loads as I have
seen it do without accident. All breeds of camels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
could not do so, but those belonging to the Hadendowah
Arabs, between the Red Sea and Taka, are
very sure-footed. The camels most highly thought
of in the Soudan are the Bishareen; they are very
strong and enduring, but not so large as many
others. There is quite as much difference in the
breeds of camels as of horses, and as much difference
in riding a hygeen and baggage camel as there
would be in riding a nice springy cob and a cart
horse. Amongst the Arabs a good “hygeen,” or
riding dromedary, is worth from 50 to 150 dollars;
the average value of a baggage camel is about 15
dollars, but I believe our average ran up to 30 or 35
dollars.</p>

<p>After this digression and short dissertation on the
camel, I will return to the subject of our journey.
We now formed a tolerably numerous company,
ourselves seven, three European servants, Suleiman,
Mahoom, Cheriff, and Ali, the cook, with an assistant,
four or five native servants, and nearly thirty
camel-drivers. George, one of our servants, and I
had some trouble in getting our makloufas properly
adjusted on our camels; consequently, we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
behind the others in starting. I also made a call
on Mr. Bewlay, who pressed me to remain to
luncheon. As I knew that this was to be a short
march of about three hours, I did so. I then bade
adieu to Mr. Bewlay (one of the nicest and most
gentlemanly fellows to be met with), and commenced
my journey, thinking I should soon overtake
my comrades, but in this I was greatly
mistaken. I had reached the middle of the town,
amongst the bazaars, when the eccentric conduct
of my camel was quite alarming, exciting grave
apprehensions respecting the safety of my limbs, I
being quite a novice in the art of camel-riding.
Down he flopped without the least preliminary
warning, whilst I held on to the makloufa as if I
had been in a hurricane. I plied my coorbatch on
his tough hide; the only effect it produced
was to make him open his mouth (to such a width
that it could easily have accommodated a human
head) and groan away with most stentorian voice.
At last an Arab succeeded in getting him on his
legs, and away he went at such a jolting pace that
I experienced the greatest difficulty in keeping my
seat. Down he flopped again in the same unceremonious
manner as before just in front of a projecting
part of the Police Station.</p>

<p>“Well,” I mentally ejaculated, “this is, indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
too much. I will not be placed in such jeopardy
as this any longer.”</p>

<p>I lost no time in dismounting; Sheik Moussa
was sent for, and at once promised to find me a
tractable beast. George remained with me. We
had no sooner unburdened the camel, and got under
the projecting roof of the Police Station, than down
came the rain in torrents; then I felt thankful that
my camel had proved so awkward and disobedient.
Two hours and a half elapsed ere a respectable
camel was brought. By that time the rain had
ceased, and George and I resumed our journey in
comfort.</p>

<p>When we arrived at camp at 6 p.m., we found the
tents pitched and everyone changing their clothes,
except Jules; they had all been drenched to the
skin. This was a favourable opportunity for me to
deliver a lecture on sanitary precautions. I therefore
did so, warning all Europeans to remember
that we were not now in England, but in the tropics,
where the days were excessively hot and the nights
not only cool, but often very cold at this time of
the year; always to change wet clothing as soon as
we got to camp; never to expose themselves to the
burning rays of a tropical sun without helmets; and
last, but not by any means least, to be extremely
careful as to the quality of water they drank, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
always to see that the zanzimeers were well washed
out before they were replenished. Well, I know
that in England, whilst practising my profession, I
have met with extremely clever people who not only
know their own business, but that of everyone else,
and are most ready with their unasked-for advice.
They are quite encyclopedias of knowledge, or, at
least, they would have one think so. They apparently
listen, with folded arms and the head a
little bit on one side, in the most attentive manner,
literally drinking in all the doctor is telling them
when he forbids this and orders that, and yet will
use their own judgment or sense—presuming, of
course, that they have any—and the moment his
back is turned they exclaim—</p>

<p>“Pooh! what an old fidget that doctor is. I
know that when poor Mrs. Smith was ill her doctor
didn’t do ought like that, but let her have a glass of
stout for dinner, and ordered her a glass of hot
whisky and water at bed-time, poor thing, and that
was what kep her up.”</p>

<p>“When the doctor very impressively says, “Now,
Mrs. Thompson, your friend is very ill—I wish you
to be careful to give her so-and-so and avoid so-and-so,”
Mrs. Thompson says, “Yes, doctor—I quite
understand;” and Mrs. T., being a very garrulous,
and also a very knowing personage, will begin a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
long rigmarole about her first husband’s case
some 20 years before, and how beautifully she
nursed him through an illness of “seven week,” as
she calls it, and brought him round, she, of course,
not having had her clothes off for four weeks, nor
a wink of sleep for ten nights, till she was a perfect
“shada,” but still able to articulate, poor thing.
Unless the poor doctor now bolts off, she will then
confidentially commence a history of three or four
other cases in which she was, of course, eminently
successful. These very clever people, so wise in
their own conceit, are really very dangerous people,
and I always look after them well. Of course, Mrs.
Thompson may think the medicine “strong enough
for a horse,” as she expresses herself, and will
administer it if <em>she</em> thinks it suits the case, and
exercise her very discriminating faculties in the way
of diet, and matters of that kind; but at the end
of a week Mrs. Thompson—who has, of course,
seen many similar cases—expresses to her neighbours
and confidants (who look upon her utterances
as oracular) her dissatisfaction with that ere doctor,
and is determined on his next visit to favour him
with what she is pleased to call a bit of her mind.
She does as promised—</p>

<p>“Well now, doctor, what do you think <em>is</em> the
matter with poor Mrs. Smith? She don’t seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
get on at all. I remember when poor Mrs. Rodgers,
my second husband’s first wife’s cousin, was laid up
with—”</p>

<p>But, reader, you may imagine the rest; I can
very well. I have used the preceding imaginary
conversation “to point a moral and adorn my tale.”</p>

<p>In our camp I had a very headstrong Mr.
“Cleverity,” if I may say so, to deal with. Jules,
before we started, was working away, sorting the
baggage, &amp;c., in his shirt sleeves after passing
through the rain, getting thirsty, and drinking bad
claret and beer, such as he could obtain in the place.
Indeed, his absorbing powers were remarkable—he
resembled a huge dry sponge, which, when
dipped into a basinful of water, absorbs it <em>all</em>. I
ascertained, from one who knew him well, that this
absorbing tendency was not altogether induced by
the heat of the climate, but that it was his normal
condition which he always suffered from in England,
where he lived a life of comparative ease and indulgence.
I only knew Jules absorb water when
he could not get anything stronger. I had warned
him at Souâkin not to get wet, as the evenings
were so cold, and now, on arriving at camp, here he
was again wet to the skin, helping to pitch tents
and put things ship-shape; but, with a thirst
unquenchable, he was continually drinking water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
which was the colour of pea-soup, but not <em>quite</em> so
thick.</p>

<p>“Now, Jules,” said I, “remember what I told
you at Souâkin. You are going the right way to
get dysentery.”</p>

<p>He replied—</p>

<p>“Oh, I am all right, doctor. I am not an old
woman, or a piece of barley-sugar. I shall take no
harm.”</p>

<p>The sequel will show how disastrous was his disregard
of my repeated warnings, and very much
grieved I was for two reasons: one was the loss of
a really good-hearted fellow, who had proved a
faithful and affectionate servant to his master, who
thought very much of him, for many years; the
other was, that although I used every effort to
save him, and many a time was unable to sleep on
account of the anxiety the case caused me, so much
so that I frequently visited his tent in the night, yet
all was of no avail. Added to this, I was excessively
and incessantly annoyed by the fussy interference of
two amateur doctors in camp, who, as educated
men, ought to have known better than to worry me
seven or eight times a day with useless suggestions
of a shadowy character as to the treatment of a
complaint of which they knew absolutely nothing.
They were great examples of an old adage, “A
<em>little</em> knowledge is a dangerous thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening of our first day’s camping out,
just after dinner (we dined at 7 p.m.), down came
the rain again, causing us all to scamper off to our
respective tents; spades were out, and trenches
dug round, and there we remained until morning.
At 6 a.m. we were up, and saw no more rain for
several months; indeed, not until I reached Venice
in the following May.</p>

<p>It was about 10 a.m. next day ere our caravan
started. The sun blazed out with a scorching heat,
causing us to feel as if we were in a Turkish
bath from the evaporation which took place, and
our solid leather portmanteaus, which were
thoroughly saturated the day before, to curl up
like match-boxes. Before we started on our second
day’s march across the desert our camel men were
told they were to go on until 6 p.m., and Suleiman
was commissioned to see this order carried out.
We often went on in front of them in the morning,
on the look out for a shot at a desert gazelle; but
it was singularly noticeable that about 1.30 p.m. we
were all somewhere in the neighbourhood of Cheriff,
our butler, who was in the charge of the canteen on
a camel. Unless we made a forced march, we
usually breakfasted about 7 a.m., luncheon at 1.30,
dined at 7, and retired to rest at 9 or 9.30 p.m. After
luncheon we frequently lay down on our rugs,
smoking cigarettes and reading some book, long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
after the caravan had passed us. This day we did
so, but judge of our astonishment when, at four
o’clock, we came upon some of our camels browsing;
others had not been unburdened, and nearly
all the camel-drivers were in a circle, with uplifted
spears.</p>

<p>We soon ascertained the cause of this; there was
poor Suleiman, our head boss, the centre of attraction
for these Hadendowab Arabs, with their uplifted
spears, who were angrily jabbering away. To the
question, “What’s the meaning of this, Suleiman?
they were to have gone on until six o’clock,” he
replied, “Yes, I know, gentlemen, that I tell them
they no stop till I say, and I catch hold of one mans
to stop him take the load off the camel, and now they
say they spear me if I don’t leave them alone.”</p>

<p>He pointed out the ringleaders of what looked like
mutiny against authority, and as soon as he had done
so, in true old English fashion, a few well-directed
blows put about five Arabs in the prone position;
all pulled out revolvers, and made them pile their
spears, which were at once secured, tied in a bundle,
and given in charge to the English servants. They
were then made to re-load all the camels, and, at
great inconvenience to ourselves, we re-start at 6.30,
and march until nearly ten, just to let them see that
they could not do as they liked, and that we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
masters and not they. This assertion of authority
had a most beneficial effect on the native mind. It
was past eleven that night ere we dined, and I retired
to rest at half-past twelve, with a feeling of general
bruising and dislocated vertebræ easily accounted
for, as I was unaccustomed to the peculiar motion
of a camel, which has a knack of shaking up one’s
liver in a most effectual manner. Referring to my
diary, I find that on our third day’s march, Dec.
17th, the temperature was 82° F. in the shade at
1.30 p.m. I generally took the temperature when
we halted for luncheon, which would usually be about
one or half-past. We could do with the dry heat
very well as we were mounted, but now, in consequence
of the late heavy rains, we felt it very relaxing,
and just like a Russian vapour-bath. The Red
Sea was still visible to the east of us; to the west, a
large tract of desert, backed up by impassable rocky
mountains. We now saw desert gazelles for the first
time, and one of the party brought one down, thus
providing dinner for the evening. We marched from
9 a.m. until 6 p.m., came to water then, and pitched
our tents near to it. We generally had very good
water, but here it had a brackish taste; still, with
the aid of four bottles of champagne, we managed to
slake our thirst tolerably well. So far the mimosa
and kittar bushes were abundant, particularly during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the first two days, but on the fourth day we saw
very few indeed, and marched through absolute
desert, saw nothing but the burning sands, and huge
rocks of volcanic origin. We filled our barrels, zanzimeers
and girbas with water before we started, and
again marched from ten till six; temp. 81° in the
shade. A girba is the skin of a gazelle dressed. It
is dressed in the following way by the Arabs:—They
get the chopped red bark of the mimosa tree,
and put in the skin with water, it is allowed to
remain there for three or four days and then it is
converted into leather. This day we encamped at a
place called Settareb. On the fifth day we again
made the usual march, and shot two gazelles. We
started off at nine—and left the caravan to follow.
About 11 a.m. one of our servants caught us up
with the information that some of the camels had
been lost. Messrs. A. and W. James returned to
see about them, and found that it was a dodge of
the camel-drivers, who thought they would try to
sneak back to Souâkin. The camels were easily
found; the two camel-drivers were tied together,
marched into camp, duly admonished and punished.
At 5 p.m. we come to water, turn out all the brackish
water, fill our barrels, &amp;c., and march until 6 p.m.;
temp. 82° in shade. Dine at 7.30, bed at 10 p.m.,
but before going to bed we had all the camel-drivers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
up, some of whom appeared inclined to be mutinous.
We gave them a sound lecturing, and let them distinctly
understand that we would not stand this kind
of thing any more, and that the next offence would
be punished with the coorbatch. Our camping
ground is called Wadi Osier. The next day, our sixth
in the desert, Mr. F. L. James and I had a somewhat
unpleasant experience. After luncheon, as
usual, we all rested awhile, allowing the caravan to
go on. Mr. F. L. J. and I, who were absorbed with
our books, remained long after our comrades had
proceeded on their journey. When at last we did
start, we were surprised to find how late it was
getting. Knowing that there is little or no twilight
in these parts, we hurried on, hoping to catch the
caravan ere darkness overtook us, but could not do
so. Darkness comes on—a most profound darkness,
too—and we lose the track; we dismount and light
matches to see if we can find it again. We don’t,
however, succeed in doing so. Nothing now remains
but to remount our camels and trust to them and
Providence. On we go, at the rate of four miles an
hour. The silence of the tomb and the darkness of
Erebus surround us; not a glimmer of light could
be seen in any direction, not the sound of a wild
animal, of a bird, or even the rustling of a leaf,
or the sigh of the softest zephyr. When we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
gone on thus for about an hour, neither seeing a
light, nor hearing a sound, we began to get uneasy,
not knowing if we were going in the right direction,
but knowing full well that it might prove to be a
serious matter if we strayed off into the limitless
waste of the desert. Every now and again I fired a
shot from my revolver, but I might as well have
used a pop-gun. Now the stars begin to make their
appearance; by them we see that we are, as we think,
pursuing some track. We now dismount, and finding
that revolvers are useless, Mr. James gets his rifle
and lets off one barrel. We wait, and anxiously look
for a corresponding flash; hear we could not, as by
this time a slight breeze had sprung up, and was
blowing from us towards our caravan. Another
barrel is now fired, but no reply. We were now
rapidly coming to the conclusion that we should have
to tie our camels to a mimosa bush, and sleep out
without food, and what was still worse, without
water, as both our zanzimeers were nearly empty.
Still we perseveringly jogged on, and after a time
discharged another barrel. In a few minutes’ time
we see a slight flash, which appears to be so far off
that we cannot make out whether it is in the heavens
or on the earth. Not a sound reaches our ears. Our
cartridges are also nearly exhausted, and we have all
but made up our minds to sleep out, but try the rifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
once more. This time both barrels are discharged
one after the other. We look out anxiously; not a
sound reaches us, but we see a corresponding double
flash a long way off, and are convinced that this
comes from our camp. We see certain stars over the
spot, and for these we steer. When we had jogged
on for another hour and a-half, we see a glimmering
light like the flicker of a lantern (it really
was a huge bonfire)—another half-hour, and we can
plainly see lanterns moving about, and to our great
relief and that of our friends, we gain the camp at
9 p.m., thoroughly hungry, thirsty, and tired. The
temperature this day was 86° in the shade; my ears
and nose were quite scorched, and smarting from
the heat of the sun.</p>

<p>On arriving in camp I found Jules very ill indeed.
On the fourth day he came to me in the evening
complaining of a bilious attack. I gave him something
for it. In some respects he was better by the
evening of the fifth, and on the morning of the 6th
bilious vomiting had ceased, but in the evening,
judging from the symptoms, I was afraid that formidable
complaint, dysentery, was setting in. However,
I kept this to myself, at present, not wishing to
alarm the camp, and hoping that treatment might
prove beneficial. We dined at 10.30, and retired to
bed at 12 p.m. When I say we retired to bed I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
literally mean that, not to a shake-down sort of
thing with a rug over me and a portmanteau for a
pillow, but a comfortable bed with a comfortable
pillow, in a comfortable tent, and cocoa-matting on
the ground. There really was an air of comfort
about all our surroundings. We had comfortable
shut-up and open-out chairs, a comfortable folding-up
table, each a nice portable india-rubber bath, and,
whenever we encamped by water we each had a bath
before breakfast and another before dinner. As for
eatables and drinkables, the most fastidious would
not turn up their noses at those. We had sufficient
champagne and claret to last us during the whole
campaign; a freezing machine, so that we could have
these iced in the hottest weather. We had gozogenes
and any amount of seltzer-water, and when we fell
short of that we used Eno’s fruit-salt in the gozogenes.
We had Peek Frean and Co’s. biscuits,
Cross and Blackwell’s excellent Chutnee pickles and
pickalili, tomato sauce, asparagus, green peas, plum
puddings, French jams, minced collops, kidneys,
tinned soups from Fortnum and Mason’s, Piccadilly,
and everything else one could think of to insure
comfort in eating, drinking, and sleeping. Some
ascetics would say we were of the earth, earthy, but
I maintain that if you mean to keep a <i lang="la">mens sana
in corpore sano</i> one may just as well—and a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
deal better—build up the waste tissue from time to
time and travel with every comfort, if one can afford
it, as do the reverse. I have tried both; whilst campaigning
in Turkey, when I have been on the march
with the army, I have indulged in the luxury of a
small onion and a limited piece of somewhat indifferent
bread for breakfast, washed down with a
drop of water, the same again for luncheon, and the
same again for dinner, “and still I was not happy,”
for I could comfortably have disposed of breakfast,
luncheon, and dinner at one sitting without the
slightest inconvenience. The ground was my bed,
the canopy of heaven was my tent, the twinkling
stars my lantern, and a stone or water-jug with a
coat rolled round it was my pillow. I shall endeavour
to avoid the slightest exaggeration in this
book, and will go so far as to say that the former
mode of travelling is by far the most comfortable,
and, in my humble opinion, the most conducive to
health.</p>

<p>Again I find myself branching off, and cannot
give any guarantee but what I may still do so. All
I ask is that my readers will overlook this little
failing of mine.</p>

<p>7th day.—We found water here, and of course replenished
everything with this valuable fluid. The
mimosas were scanty and very stunted here. During<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the night and all this day a great wind has been
blowing, producing a most blinding sand-storm,
fortunately at our backs, or we should not have
been able to proceed. No one can form any idea of
the intense discomfort of a sand-storm, unless he
has been in one. I may close up my tent and be
roasted inside. I may lock up my portmanteau,
which fits pretty closely, and have it in my tent, the
lock covered with leather, yet when I go to bed I
find the sheets brown with sand, the most secret recesses
of my portmanteau and the lock filled with
sand, and my writing-case also, which is inside. I
open my mouth to speak, and I can masticate sand,
if so disposed. I eat—all my food is full of sand.
I drink, not water, but water and sand. In fact,
sand is everywhere; eyes, nose, mouth, ears, hair,
brains, and everything else has a mixture of sand
about it. I chance to leave a book, a pair of boots,
or anything else outside my tent, they soon become
invisible, and are covered inches deep in sand. Here
we found great difficulty in pitching our tents, as
there was nothing but sand to drive the pegs into,
and then we came to rocks. Three or four days
ago a lame woman and a man joined our caravan,
and two days ago two men, all bound for Kassala,
all pilgrims from Mecca. They were allowed to
accompany us, and we fed them. To-day we miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the woman, and on inquiry find that she was
knocked up <i lang="fr">en route</i> yesterday, and so her companion
left her to die, and probably when we discovered
this she had been picked clean by jackals
and vultures. Such is the value put upon human
life out here.</p>

<p>8th day.—The sand-storm still rages with unabated
violence. We decide not to go on, but encamp
here to-day. We are, however, obliged to
move our tents to a place that is a little more
sheltered, as at present it is absolutely miserable.
Jules still very ill. Temperature 86° in the shade.
In the day time the fierce heat of the sun rendered
the interior of the tents like ovens. Outside the
sand reflected the heat. Although producing great
personal discomfort, our sufferings were nothing to
what poor Jules endured, who is now unmistakably
suffering from dysentery badly. Under any circumstances
this is a grave complaint to have, but
under present circumstances, doubly so; that which
he requires is impossible to obtain, namely, absolute
rest and a suitable diet. The poor fellow complains
to-day of incessant thirst, and everything he gets to
eat or drink is impregnated with sand, which it is
impossible to avoid.</p>

<p>About 12 meridie, Mr. Phillipps, who was passing
across the camp, saw the two pilgrims whom we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
allowed to join the caravan, two brothers. One was
supporting the head of the other in the blazing sun.
The poor fellow’s eyes, nose, ears, and hair, &amp;c.
were full of sand. He said his brother was ill. I
was at once called to him, and found him <i lang="la">in articulo
mortis</i>. Very little could be done for him, and in
twenty minutes’ time he died. His brother borrowed
a spade, dug a shallow grave near the camp and
buried him, putting a mound of little white stones
on the grave. In my journey across the desert I
frequently came across these graves, sometimes two
or three together, sometimes 20, 50, or 100.
Occasionally skeletons of camels were met with.
In the present instance, the poor fellow who died
looked very emaciated and weak, probably exhausted
by constant marching and a deficient supply of food.
But he had accomplished the pilgrimage to Mecca,
and I suppose he died a happy man.</p>

<p>9th day.—Poor Jules is so ill to-day that I cannot
consent to have him removed. The camp is accordingly
split up, Mr. Phillipps and I, with a few camels
and attendants, remaining behind. The sand-storm
is abating, but the heat is very great and trying to
Jules. A gazelle was shot to-day. I cannot say that
gazelle is a particularly toothsome morsel under our
circumstances. We are obliged to cook it on the
same day that it has been killed. The flesh of a desert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
gazelle is hard, and has very little flavour. Our
comrades left us about 10 a.m., and directly they
had gone down came the vultures for pickings.</p>

<p>10th day.—Jules still very ill, but in some respects
a trifle better. We decide on advancing to-day,
if possible, and encamp a little longer when
we get to water. Accordingly we strike our tents
and help the camel men to load, send them on, then
see to our own. We do not get off until 4.30 p.m.
Half-an-hour afterwards we come to a dry river
course, on each side of which are dhoum palms and
other trees. We saw a couple of jackals sneaking
off here, but did not get a shot at them. We trusted
to one of our Arabs to show us the way. When
we had gone on for about an hour, he suddenly
stopped in the middle of a great sandy plain, said
he was not sure of the way, and as it was getting
dark, thought we had better stop until daylight.
On hearing this Mr. Phillipps retraced his steps,
and was absent about two hours. I now became
anxious about him, and every now and then fired off
my revolver. Fortunately I happened to have a box
of matches with me, and kindled a fire, then Mahoom
and I tore up all the stuff that would ignite. Half-an-hour
afterwards Mr. Phillipps found us, but he
had been unsuccessful in his search for the road.
However, we kept up the fire, hoping some of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
camel men would see the signals of distress, which
fortunately they did after a time; at last one of them
found us. In the meantime Jules was lying on the
ground exhausted, with a rug thrown over him.
Our man led us to where the other camels were.
Now we had another bother: one of the camels had
thrown his load off; the old fellow who was in
charge was lying on the ground, said he had got a
pain in his stomach, and we must stop there, as he
could not possibly go on. We roused him up, gave
him a good shaking, and made him come on. But
he soon stopped again, and laid down to sleep, most
coolly saying he could not go any further. The
fact is that just before we started he had eaten a
large quantity of raw meat, had, in fact, thoroughly
gorged himself. However, there we left him, and
went on another two or three miles. Halted at 10
p.m. and kindled a fire, had a cup of cocoa, a bit of
bread, rolled ourselves up in rugs, and lay on the
ground. Jules suffered much from this, as the
nights were so cold.</p>

<p>11th day.—Up early, feeling stiff, cold, and
hungry. Marched until 10 a.m. (four hours), intending
to rest during the excessive heat of the day,
as my poor invalid was almost too weak to set up.
About 3 p.m. Mr. F. L. James appears on the scene,
and tells us that the camp is only about four miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
off, at a place called Waudy. We get there about
6.30 p.m., and find the camp pitched near a well
surrounded by dhoum palms. Temperature to-day,
88° in the shade. This being Christmas Day, we
had some excellent plum puddings, made by Crosse
and Blackwell, iced champagne, and other luxuries
for dinner.</p>

<p>12th day.—Jules was very ill indeed to-day,
thoroughly prostrated by his complaint, which had
increased in intensity—it was quite out of the
question for him to attempt to move. We held a
council, and decided that as there were a few huts
and goats, and a well, that it would be advisable to
let Jules rest here awhile, for now we could get a
little milk for him twice a day. Accordingly on the
13th day the camp was split up. Messrs. A. and W.
James, Colvin, and Aylmer went on to Kassala,
whilst Jules, Messrs. Phillipps, F. L. James, and I
remained behind. Here we rested for five days,
and what with treatment, diet, and rest Jules improved
daily.</p>

<p>On the 16th day we rigged up an augarip (a kind
of litter), with an awning of matting and palm
leaves to keep off the sun, and on the 17th day this
was slung across a camel. Jules got into it, and
off we started at 7.30 a.m., marching until 7.30 p.m.
Much too long a journey for Jules, who was again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
thoroughly knocked up and exhausted. I suggested
now that such marches were too long, and that our
best plan was for me to start off early with Jules,
say 6 a.m., and march until 10, then rest until 4 and
go on until 7 or 8 p.m. This was agreed to.</p>

<p>18th day. January 1st, 1883.—I visited Jules at
6 a.m.; found him no worse. We started at 8, halt
at 12, rest until 2, and go on until we catch up the
caravan, at 8.30 p.m. Jules complained bitterly of
these long journeys, which were so exhausting to an
invalid. Medicine was now out of the question, as
the rolling motion of the camel made him very sick.
At the mid-day halt we found some empty huts in
the desert. These we explored, and found rather
interesting. In several of them I found a hole in
the floor, the use of which is rather singular. The
good wife of the house uses this. She gets certain
fragrant barks and frankincense, burns them in the
hole, then stands over them, having her dress drawn
round her, to fumigate herself and make herself
acceptable to her husband. In England, of course,
this is not at all necessary. We passed through a
fine palm-grove to-day by a khor, and shot three
gazelles.</p>

<p>19th day.—March again about 12 hours. Jules
worse. Again I pointed out the bad effect of these
long marches on the invalid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>20th day.—Ten hours’ march to-day; halt near a
deep well and a large palm-grove. Here I shot a
fine golden-crested eagle. Jules frightfully done up,
and rapidly going the wrong way.</p>

<p>21st day.—On the march at 9 a.m. We marched
the greater part of this day across an awful desert,
where no living thing except ourselves could be
seen. No shelter was attainable for the mid-day
lunch. Temperature 92° in what shade we could
manufacture. During several hours of the day I
saw that optical illusion which so often mocks the
thirsty traveller, called the mirage—mirage, called
by the Arabs, Bahr esh Sheitan, “The Devil’s Sea.”
By a strange refraction of the atmosphere, plains of
arid sands seem to be rippling lakes of water as far
as the eye can reach, lapping the base of stupendous
mountains of rocks, and bathing the roots of the
stunted mimosa bushes. This day marched nearly
14 hours. Jules takes scarcely anything, is rapidly
sinking, and again complains of these long marches.</p>

<p>22nd day.—Another 12 hours’ march. See mirage
again for hours. Encamp at Fillick. Here there is
a military station and a telegraph office.</p>

<p>23rd day.—Mirage again. Shot two gazelles, four
bustards, and five guinea-fowl. Appear to be getting
into a better country. Jules much weaker, pulse
scarcely perceptible. Ten hours’ march to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>24th day.—Eleven hours’ march to-day, and, I am
thankful to say, the last day’s march across the
desert. Temperature 93° in the shade. Since 11
a.m. we have travelled through much better country,
and after our late experience it was quite refreshing
to see a luxuriant vegetation once more, such as
dhoum palms, colocynth, tamarisks, nebbucks,
heglecks—not stunted mimosa bushes now, but
different kinds of mimosa trees and various trees
and shrubs. The place I am speaking of was quite
like a gentleman’s park. Here also were ariels,
gazelles, bustards, parroquets, eagles, vultures, and
jackals. About seven, and pitch-dark, we, for the
first time, heard the roar of a lion not far off. Our
sensations were of a creepy character, and would,
perhaps, have been more so had we known what we
did when we got to Kassala—that he had lately
dined, at separate times, on four human beings.</p>

</div>

<p>We arrived at Kassala at 8 p.m., and found the
camp pitched about a quarter of a mile, or less, from
it, close to a garden full of fine trees of various kinds;
in fact, between this garden and a very wide river
bed. This river is here called the Gash, but nearer
to Abyssinia it is called the Mareb. Jules’ exhaustion
and pulseless condition was most alarming. I
succeeded in obtaining some eggs and milk; these I
mixed with brandy, and had this mixture administered
to him every half-hour.</p>

<p>Whilst we were dining, at 9 p.m., we heard the
peculiar cry of hyænas, which literally swarm round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the camp at night and make an awful row. I daresay
there would be 150 or 200 come round every
night after dark, and when we retired to our tents,
and the lights were put out, they would not only
come close to, but actually into the camp; I can
assure the reader that I am not, as it is called,
drawing the long bow when I say that I have seen
one poke his head in at my tent door more than
once. We remained here many days, and sometimes
the hyænas would be so troublesome and
noisy that it was a by no means uncommon thing
for one of us to get up in the night, go to the edge
of the camp in our night-shirt and discharge the
contents of one or two barrels into the noisy crowd.
This had a quieting effect, and we often found
one or two dead hyænas in the morning, the
rest having scampered off.</p>

<p>We found Kassala a very warm place, for in the
middle of January the thermometer registered 90°
in the shade. It is situated about 1,900 feet above
the level of the sea, is surrounded by a wall made
of mud bricks baked in the sun, and plastered over
with mud and the refuse of cows. The wall is
loop-holed for musketry, and surrounded by a deep
fosse. The exports of the Soudan are ivory, hides,
gum arabic, senna, bees’ wax, and honey—the latter
obtained chiefly from the Abyssinian border.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>The Kassala Mountain, which is just outside
Kassala, is an enormous, almost perpendicular,
mass of granite, several thousand feet in height,
rising straight out of the plain, and can be seen for
many miles in all directions. The population was
in 1882, something like 25,000, without reckoning
the garrison, which consisted of about 1,000 Nubian
troops.</p>

<p>There are large numbers of cows, goats, sheep,
and camels in the neighbourhood, and a great deal
of camel-breeding is carried on here.</p>

<p>When I left England, the thought occurred to me
that it would be a good idea to take out some
knives, razors, beads, and so forth, both as presents
and for barter. I, therefore, provided myself with
some common knives, about a dozen of a better class,
and half-dozen hunting-knives from Mr. T. B.
Hague, of Sheffield; a couple of dozen of Mappin
and Webb’s, and Heiffer’s shilling razors, which
were much prized by the Arabs. These I found
very useful at Kassala, as I bartered some of them
for a dozen beautiful long ostrich feathers, and a
handful of shorter ones. The natives were well
pleased, and so was I.</p>

<p>January 8th.—We were now comfortably encamped,
but, alas! too late for Jules, who was
fearfully emaciated and prostrate. I visited his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
tent twice in the night, at one and four o’clock, but
could do very little more for him, and I fear he will
soon go. All the camels that we hired at Souâkin
will have to return there with their drivers. One
reason our friends preceded us to Kassala was to let
it be known that we wanted to buy or hire camels.
The result was not exactly what we anticipated, for
they kept them back awhile. When at last they
were brought for inspection, the most extravagant
prices were demanded, whilst many of them were
absolute screws. We also required a few little
horses for hunting purposes; the dealers were as
knowing as horse-dealers in England, and that is
saying a great deal.</p>

<p>January 9th.—Jules is evidently sinking fast. I
visited his tent five times in the night, but could
do little for him beyond giving him drink twice.
Mr. W. James and Mr. Aylmer had taken lessons in
photography before leaving England, and were each
provided with a good apparatus. With these they
took many interesting views in different parts of
the country. This day the Mudir (Governor) of
Kassala sent his two little boys and ponies to be
photographed. Whilst we were at breakfast to-day
an Arab brought two playful little leopards, which
he had stolen from their nest. I could have bought
them for a couple of dollars each, and probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
should have done so had I been on my way home.
The Mudir paid us a visit at noon, inviting us all to
dine with him; but Mr. Phillipps and I could not
go on account of Jules’s illness, which now will be
of short duration. I understood afterwards from
those who did go that the dinner consisted of
15 or 18 courses. About 5 p.m. I visited Jules,
and found him asleep, but evidently sinking.
Mahoom, who was my servant during the whole
campaign—and a very good boy he was, too—attended
well to him, and frequently sat up at
nights with him. At 10 p.m. poor Jules breathed
his last. The particulars of his illness, together
with other curious and interesting medical notes,
can be found in an article of mine in the <cite>British
Medical Journal</cite>, September 23rd and 30th, 1882.
As soon as he was dead I washed and laid him
out. M. Demetrius Mosconas, a Greek living in
Kassala, was good enough to at once see about
some kind of coffin, covered with black cloth,
shaped thus—</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/coffin.jpg" width="200" height="45" alt="Sketch of a coffin shape" />
</div>

<p class="noindent">This was to be sent early in the morning.</p>

<p>January 10th.—At 10 a.m. the coffin was brought.
Jules was put in it. On the corpse were laid sprays
of green shrubs all round. At 11.30 he was carried
to his last resting-place by natives, all of us following;
the Union Jack being placed on the coffin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
The weather was fearfully hot, and the roads very
dusty. He was buried in a garden where three
other Christians had been buried. Mr. F. L. James
read the burial service, and we remained by the grave
until it was filled up, which was very quickly done
in the following manner: The earth had been
thrown up each side of the grave, eight Arabs stood
each side with their backs to the grave, and as soon
as the word was given they, with their hands,
pushed the earth between their legs, filling the
grave within about ten minutes. A cross was
afterwards made of ebony by Mr. Phillipps, and
placed at the head of the grave. This concluded
our last duty to poor Jules.</p>

<p>When we returned to camp, four horses and
four camels were bought; after lunch Messrs.
Colvin and A. James, with Suleiman and a few
servants, started off for the Atbara in quest of
camels, as these people were holding theirs back in
the hopes of making a good thing by so doing.
Korasi, on the Atbara, is considered one of the
cheapest and best places to buy camels.</p>

<p>January 11th.—Soon after my arrival at Kassala
it became known that there was a “Hakeem
Ingelese,” as they called me, and I very soon found
that my patients daily increased in number. Every
morning after breakfast there was I, wearing my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
pith helmet, in the broiling sun, with Mahoom as
interpreter, for two hours or more attending to a
large number of Arabs—men, women, and children—who
squatted round my tent on their haunches in a
semicircle. I frequently saw 60, 70, or 80 patients
a day. I did not charge them anything; probably,
had I done so I should have materially thinned out
the applicants for medical and surgical relief. It is
a strange thing, but human nature is (in some
respects) pretty much the same in Central Africa as
it is in England.</p>

<p>Ali Mahoom’s history, poor boy, was not, in early
life, a very bright one, as he was stolen by the slave-dealers.
He said—</p>

<p>“I remember very well, sir, when dey took me.
My mother was out when a lot of mens come down
and took all de little childrens dey see. Dey took
me with dem to Khartoum, and dere my mother
found me. Dey let her stop with me for a long time.
She begged dem to let her have her little boy back,
but dey say, ‘No, unless you steal two little children;
den you shall have him back.’ Den I was sold to
somebody else; after dat Gordon Pasha find me,
and he take me and give me to Mr. Felkin, and he
has been good to me ever since.” He gave me the
name of the country he came from, but I forget it,
adding, “It is the next country but one to the
Niam-Niams.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>I had heard they were cannibals, so I said to
Mahoom—</p>

<p>“What do they eat, Mahoom?”</p>

<p>“Dey eat de flesh of beobles,” he replied.</p>

<p>“But,” I said, “why don’t they eat antelopes and
other animals?”</p>

<p>“Dey say de flesh of beobles is much nicer,” he
replied.</p>

<p>He, of course, was disgusted with them. I found
also that if a relation dies they bury that relation in
close relation to them, that is, at the entrance to the
hut; and if a baby, they send it to the relatives
they have most respect for, and these relatives, to
show their respect for their friends, eat the baby—cooked,
I presume, but that I am not sure of.</p>

<p>About noon M. Demetrius Mosconas (who spoke
English fairly well, and is, in a certain sense, a
brother) asked me to go and see his son, who was
very ill. I did so, and found him suffering from
acute rheumatism. Mosconas, it seems, was
engaged by the Government in sinking wells in
some outlying districts, and his son, who partly
superintended this work, must have contracted this
disease by sleeping out, as, although the days were
very hot, the nights were often excessively cold, and
I have often known the thermometer sink from 90°
at 1.30 p.m. to 45° or lower by 11 p.m.</p>

<p>I had a talk with Mosconas about slavery, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
learnt very conclusively that it exists pretty
openly in this part of the Soudan. He informed
me that the woman (his servant) who had just
brought us two small cups of coffee was a slave,
one of a dozen owned by an Arab woman, and she
realized a living by letting them out on hire. He
paid three dollars per month for the hire of this slave.
He also told me that Georgie Bey, an Arab Army
doctor, who left Kassala for Khartoum the day before
our arrival, sold two of his slaves before he went.
This Georgie Bey was since killed with Hicks
Pasha’s army near Souâkin.</p>

<p>Another bit of information which Mosconas gave
me was that some Arabs and Greeks breed from
slave-women, who are kept for profit just as cattle
are in England. The children born under these
circumstances are sold by their fathers.</p>

<p>Having had a long chat with Mosconas, I next
paid a visit to Herr Schumann’s collection of wild
animals. I found a large building and yard
occupied by them. Schumann himself was away
some distance from Kassala, amongst the Beni-Amir
tribe, where he had a zareeba. He collected animals
there, and sent them on to his manager at Kassala.
Just before the rainy season commenced, about May,
he would go on himself, with quite an army
of attendants, across the Nubian Desert to Souâkin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
with his collection; then take them to London,
Liverpool, Hamburg, Vienna, and America, where
they would be sold. Here he had four giraffes, four
gazelles, three fine antelopes, as tame as lambs, a nice,
amiable little baby elephant, five young lions, chained
to rickety old posts, which rattled up, as they darted
at a passer-by, in a very alarming manner, nine
infant leopards, two or three young hyænas, eight
ostriches, some wild hogs, baboons, tiger-cats, and
other animals.</p>

<p>CAMELS FROM THE ATBARA—THE MUDIR—GORDON PASHA’S
CHARACTER IN THE SOUDAN—FERTILITY OF THE SOUDAN.</p>

</div>

<p>January 15th.—Messrs. Colvin and A. James, with
their attendants, returned this afternoon from the
Atbara, having purchased thirty-four camels. This
rather astonished the natives here, who had no idea
that we could do without theirs, and quite thought
we should be obliged eventually to buy their camels,
and of course give them a good price. Whilst our
friends were gone to the Atbara, we bought sixteen
camels, eight ponies, a number of sheep, and some
milk-giving goats, so that we could have milk with
our porridge every morning for breakfast. It was
decided to-day that we must hire a few more camels
for our march from here to the Beni-Amirs, and leave
Kassala on the 17th.</p>

<p>January 16th.—Mosconas dined with us to-night;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
he says that a year ago King John’s nephew, of
Abyssinia, whilst fighting with some of the Arab
tribes, was killed, and that a Shukeryiah Arab took
out his heart and ate it on the spot. He said that
these Hadendowahs, Beni-Amirs, Shukeriyahs, Hamrans,
and others, are always fighting, either with
the Abyssinians or amongst themselves, and that in
consequence of the frequent raids made by the Egyptian
governors on the Arabs for taxes, the latter frequently
hide their money in the ground, putting oil
on it to prevent discolouration. He also informed
me that the present Mudir of Kassala was a very
sharp fellow, and extremely successful in squeezing
money out of the poor Arabs, but that Gordon Pasha,
when he was Governor of the Soudan, was very
kind and lenient, frequently remitting taxes when he
thought they were unduly pressed.</p>

<p>Now my own opinion of Gordon Pasha is that he
was a just, honest, and honourable man, whose sole
aim was, not to extort all he could from these poor
Arabs, and so make himself popular at head-quarters,
but to do that which was simply right between man
and man, just to those who employed him, and to
those whom he ruled. I believe I should not be far
wrong in saying that all Egyptian governors who
preceded and succeeded him were <em>extortionists</em>. What
a charm his name had in the Soudan, amongst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
different tribes in different parts! I have noticed
that when Gordon’s name was mentioned the Arab’s
countenance would become radiant with pleasure, as
if calling up recollections of a good friend in bygone
days, and with a significant, “Ah! Gordon Pasha,”
they would begin to expatiate on his good qualities
in such a way that I could not help thinking that he
had more influence amongst them than any man
living. The fact is, that these poor down-trodden
Arabs had, unknowingly, adopted one of our own
texts, “Prove all things, hold fast that which is
good.” Gordon Pasha was kind to them, and when
he passed his word he would keep it, whether it
clashed with the interests of the Khedive or not.
He was the only man as a governor whom they
trusted as children would their father, and who
never forfeited their confidence. All his actions
were summed up in the words justice, truth, and duty.</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">A wit’s a feather,</div>
<div class="verse">A chief’s a rod,</div>
<div class="verse">An honest man’s the noblest work of God.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">As I am writing this (March 30th, 1884),
I cannot help thinking that, had Gordon Pasha been
sent out to the Soudan nine months ago, before the
wave of rebellion had increased to raging billows,
sweeping over the land, we should have been spared
the painful events which have taken place there quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
lately, and by this time the Mahdi would have been
little heard of. Then Gordon Pasha would have
come on them like the noon-day sun, and all the
tribes would have flocked round him as a deliverer,
whilst the Mahdi would have been powerless, and
relegated to the obscurity from which he had sprung.
What a country Egypt and the Soudan might become
under British rule! In Lower Egypt we should
form a net-work of canals in communication with
the Nile, as in the days of Pharaoh; then thousands
upon thousands of acres, which to-day look sterile
deserts, would be made to yield enormous quantities
of sugar-cane, cotton, flax, dhurra, &amp;c., and at least
two crops in the year could be obtained. Politics I
have nothing to do with. I am simply giving an
expression to an opinion which I formed when in
the Soudan and Egypt. This opinion I expressed
in January, 1882, when in the Soudan, and subsequently
very many times since in England. It is a
source of great satisfaction to me that so eminent an
authority as Sir Samuel Baker, F.R.G.S., entertains
the same ideas. As things now are, extensive cultivation
in the Soudan would be almost useless, the
only means of exporting their products being by the
very slow method of camels to the nearest sea-port;
taxes would increase, and the only people who would
derive any benefit would be the Egyptians, not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Arabs. If we ruled there we would appoint an
English governor, who would let the Arabs live on
their own industry, if they had any, and, if not,
bring the fallaheen there, and take only a reasonable
share of taxation. We should put down a railway
from Souâkin to Kassala, from there to Massawah
and elsewhere. We should sink wells, and
erect engines which would pump up sufficient water
to irrigate thousands of acres of the most fertile
land. These lands require no manuring, nothing but
clearing, scratching the rich alluvial deposit, and
putting in the seeds. The crops when gathered could
then be transported by rail to Souâkin, which would
soon become a flourishing port, could, in fact, be
transferred direct from central Africa to any English
port within three weeks or so. Senna, coffee, tobacco,
cotton, sugar, flax, dhurra, wheat, oats, oranges,
lemons, and I don’t know what, could be grown there
without the least trouble, besides which, hides, honey,
beeswax, and other things would be abundant. I
was so struck, soon after we left Kassala, with the
immensely fertile appearance of the soil, and the vast
extent of country capable of cultivation, and of producing
two crops a year at least, that I mentioned
this to Mr. Colvin, as we rode side by side on our
camels, afterwards making a note of the same in my
diary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Every night of our stay at Kassala the monotonous
beating of the tom-tom would commence about
8 p.m. and continue incessantly till about twelve, accompanied
by the most extraordinary shrill trilling
note of a female every now and then. It seems there
had been a death in the family, and on all occasions
of great joy and sorrow this unpleasant musical
entertainment is at once provided. Mosconas tells
me that, after a death, the mourners go on in this kind
of way every night for about a month, and a very irritating
performance it is to our untutored English
auditory nerves. We found the white ants very troublesome
here. They are very destructive little insects,
and, I believe, will destroy everything but iron and
stone. If a strong, solid, leather portmanteau be left
on the ground for two or three nights, they will
destroy it, but if two stones, sufficient to raise it an
inch or two from the ground, be placed underneath,
they will not touch it, and if we encamp on sand we
are safe from them. They destroyed all the matting
laid down in our tents during the few days that we
were here, although it was taken up and beaten
every day. Scorpions as well as white ants were
frequently found underneath the matting. This is
very cheap, indeed; we therefore secured a fresh lot.</p>

</div>

<p>All being ready, we started off from Kassala at 3
p.m. on the 17th January, intending to reach
Heikota within three days. We encamped at 8
p.m., and next day were off at 9 a.m., marching
until 6 p.m.—temp. 90° in shade. Fine trees
became more numerous; the country looked much
greener, and water was usually obtainable every
day simply by digging a few feet in the sandy
river-bed. This day we passed through a large
field of dhurra. To guard this from elephants,
birds, and buffaloes several platforms were erected
in different parts of the field about 10 or 12 feet
high, and on these boys and men spent the whole
day unsheltered from the scorching rays of the
sun—which was like a ball of fire—cracking whips<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and uttering hideous noises. We came across
distinct and recent tracks of a lion, two full-grown
and one young elephant. I also saw a
few monkeys, a musk cat, several young tiger-cats
and hundreds of guinea-fowl. We shot on the
march one eagle, two ariels, and two gazelles;
the latter are not so hard and dry as those in
the desert.</p>

<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="500" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE KASSALA MOUNTAIN.</p>
</div>

<p>On the 19th we made the usual march, encamping
at Ashberra. The general character of the
country has now become much more varied and
interesting. This day we travelled through tall
grass, about 10 feet high, for a long time—perhaps
an hour. When we got out of this we found
ourselves encountering the prickly thorns of the
mimosa and kittar bushes. We had now done with
caravan routes entirely, and my camel-riding capabilities
were fully tested as I go up and down
hill; now over rocky hills, down steep banks and
across dry river-courses, then through a forest of
dhoum palms, dodging as I go the great projecting
strong branches, which appear strong enough
almost to decapitate or sweep me off my camel.
Then, by way of variety, we pass through a mile
or two of the horrid cruel thorns of the mimosa
and kittar trees, which every now and then bury
themselves in my flesh, and tear my clothes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
helmet as I duck my head to avoid having my
face lacerated. The camel, of course, walks on in
the most unconcerned manner, just as if he was on
open ground, taking no notice whatever of these
obstructions, but brushing past them as if they
were twigs or straws. Everything, even the smallest
of the mimosa tree, is armed with long, strong, very
sharp thorns. Each thorn is as sharp as a needle and
about an inch long; indeed, the native women use
them as a cobbler does his awl, and I have often
seen a woman using the thorn to pierce a girba and
shreds of the palm leaf to sew it up with. The
thorns of the kittar bushes are quite semicircular in
shape, very near to each other, not long but very
strong, and each successive thorn crooks in a
different direction to its predecessor—one crooks up
and the other down. When they catch hold of anyone
they stick to him as close as a brother. If my
clothes get entangled, I must stay and pick myself
out, or if I elect to go on without doing so, I must
submit to having my clothes, and perchance my
flesh, effectually torn across. We saw <i lang="fr">en route</i> a
great many baboons, vultures of course always,
eagles, thousands of doves, guinea-fowl, and recent
tracks of elephants, lions, and leopards. Mr. Phillipps
and I, whilst stalking some gazelles in a large palm-grove,
lost the caravan for hours, and just as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
emerged from it on to the wide river-bed of the
Mareb we came upon a large number of the Beni-Amir
tribe in that semi-nude condition, which is
so fashionable amongst them, watering their goats
and cattle. We dismounted and joined the sable
throng, made them understand that we should like
some goat’s milk, which they gave us, after which
we showed them our pocket and hunting knives,
revolvers, and watches. We were at once surrounded
by an admiring throng of our new acquaintances,
who seemed greatly pleased with what
they saw, but when I applied my watch to the ear
of one his surprise and delight was immense, for he
had never in his life seen a watch before. The
ticking tickled him greatly, so much so that he
pushed all his friends forward one after the other
to participate in his joy. However, as the long bushy
hair of these fellows was streaming with fat, I
observed caution.</p>

<p>January 20th.—We were off at 9.30, and had not
far to go ere we reached Heikota, where the Beni-Amir
tribe then lived. This was the shortest march
we ever made, for we arrived there at 11 a.m.,
amongst the most luxuriant vegetation, encamping
just by a huge baobob tree (<i lang="la">Adamsonia digitata</i>),
51 feet in girth. Large as this may seem, it is not
by any means as large as they grow—they are frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
60 to 85 feet in girth. The trunk is not
above 12 feet high ere the branches are put forth.
The flowers are in proportion to the size of the
tree, and followed by a fruit about 10 inches long.
This looks like a greenish pod or capsule, having a
bloom on it such as we see on a plum; on breaking
the capsule we find a large number of granular-like
substances very much resembling pieces of white
starch packed closely together, which have an
agreeable sub-acid flavour. When this white substance,
which is very thin, is dissolved, and it does
so readily in the mouth, we came to a dark,
brownish little stone, very much like a tamarind
stone in appearance, but smaller. When dry, the
pulp, by which the seeds are surrounded, is
powdered and brought to Europe from the Levant,
under the name of <i lang="la">terra sigillata lemnia</i>—the seeds
are called <em>goui</em>.</p>

<p>Ere we could pitch our tents we had to cut down a
number of young palm trees, and clear away a
quantity of tall grass, &amp;c. Whilst doing so Sheik
Ahmed, of the powerful Beni-Amir tribe, who paid
us a visit, gave us a good deal more of manual
labour by advising us to make a zareeba (a fence
of prickly trees), assigning as a reason, and a
very substantial one, the fact that lions came down
every night, and often made such a noise as to
disturb his slumbers, but that we had nothing to fear
from his tribe. He said further that boa-constrictors
and scorpions were very common, leopards also.
We found traces of the latter whilst clearing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Sheik Ahmed, or Achmet, is said to be one of the
most powerful Sheiks in the Soudan; he certainly
was far and away the best sample of a Sheik that
I have seen anywhere. His head was kept shaved;
on it he wore a tight-fitting white skull-cap. He
was almost black, and of a determined aspect, but
his features were good, and his teeth white, sound
and regular; his eyes were keen, black and glittering
as a hawk’s; he was dressed in spotless white
and scrupulously clean; quick in action, thought,
speech, and appearance. One might almost say really
that he was an educated man, for he could both
write and read, and certainly looked a remarkable,
shrewd, and intelligent man. During the piping
times of peace he could be a merry fellow of infinite
jest; and he and I cracked many a joke together by
the aid of an interpreter. He could also be a fierce
warrior when necessary, and bore marks, some deep
ones, too, of many a skirmish he had been engaged
in. “Beware of entrance to a quarrel, but being in
at it, bear thyself, that thine opponent may beware of
thee.” The latter half of this proverb, I think,
would be quite applicable to our friend, Sheik
Ahmed, as all his wounds were in front; the first
part, I fear, he would be rather regardless of, probably,
indeed, more of the temper of an Irishman
handling a shillelagh at Donnybrook fair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
exclaiming—“Will ye jist thread on the tail of me coat,
now?” And I assure you, reader, that had you
known Sheik Ahmed you would hesitate ere you
trod on his caudal appendage, if you discovered it.
I have heard that he is one of the most powerful
vassals under the Khedive, and that should occasion
require he could put in the field about 10,000 horsemen
and tribesmen.</p>

<p>These people, over whom the Sheik seemed to
possess great control and authority, are quite
pastoral in their pursuits, and own such enormous
flocks and herds as would astonish any ordinary
mortal. These are every night driven in from grazing
to a large zareeba on the river-bed. I was irresistibly
reminded here of the patriarchs of old.
Here was this Sheikh with four wives and I don’t
know how many children, the leader or petty
sovereign of a large and powerful tribe, over whom
he possessed absolute power, and, as I said before,
owning these flocks and herds. On the river-bed of
the Mareb the tribe, or a part of it rather, lived,
their dwellings simply consisting of a few stakes
driven into the sand, over and around which is a
covering of tall grass and matting made from the
palm leaves. They live in this neighbourhood as
long as there is anything for their flocks and herds
to eat; when there is not, like locusts, they move off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
a few miles to pastures new. Then, when the wet
season commences, they clear off to the mountains
or desert, else the tetse fly would destroy the
animals. They seem a contented lot, and may
truly say, as a deceased M.P. once said, “My riches
consist, not in the vastness of my possessions, but
in the fewness of my wants.”</p>

<p>They live simply, on milk, honey, and dhurra
principally, and to that fact may be attributed the
beautifully white sound teeth they possess. I think
I ought to say that the Sheik was good enough to
ask me to stay with the tribe for three or four
years, and as an inducement was good enough to
say that if I would he would give me four wives,
thus placing me on a par with himself. However, I
neither embraced this tempting offer nor the sable
females, and here I think the utterances of the
deceased M.P. would be peculiarly applicable.
When the Sheik, who was very friendly, left us,
he accepted our invitation to dinner at 7 p.m. Quite
close to our camp was another zareeba; in this dwelt
Herr Schumann and his wild animals. He had,
when we were there, three young elephants; two
females, and one rogue (the latter, being a rather
fierce little fellow, was chained by the leg), a few
young lions, wild cats, leopards, and 15 young
ostriches about the size of Dorking fowls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p><i lang="fr">Apropos</i> of the Mahdi, I find the following in
to-day’s paper:</p>

<p>“April 2nd, ’84—An Austrian dealer in wild
animals, writing from Kassala to friends in Vienna,
gives some information about the Mahdi, whom he
knows personally, and with whom he has frequently
transacted business, the Mahdi himself having for
years past dealt in wild beasts for the different
European Zoological Gardens. He is described by
the writer as a very cunning impostor, and as an instance,
it is related that a short time ago he suddenly
appeared with a number of warts on his right
cheek, these having been artificially produced by
the aid of a German called Schandorper, formerly a
clown, and afterwards a hairdresser, now in the
service of the Mahdi. The reason was that the
legends about the expected Mahdi speak of him as
having such marks. Like the beasts he formerly
dealt in, the Mahdi sleeps in the daytime and transacts
business during the night.” I have no doubt
whatever that our old acquaintance, who was the
only animal collector I ever met with, is the author
of the preceding, and I think a very credible man.</p>

<p>In the evening, just before dinner, we heard near
our camp a great number of women and children,
accompanied by the inevitable beating of the tom-toms,
and that wild, peculiar trilling note of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
woman to which I have before alluded. Being
desirous to find out as much as I could of the habits
and customs of these people, I got Mr. Colvin to accompany
me to ascertain the cause. We went and
found a great number of women shouting and chanting,
whilst a number of their braves were executing
a war dance with spear and shield, others in the
meantime sharpening their spears. Of course we
were at a loss to account for the extreme activity
and evident war-like preliminaries, and returned to
camp not feeling certain whether these sharpened
spears would not on the morrow make unpleasant
incisions in our intercastal spaces—at least Mr.
Colvin, who was a very facetious and witty fellow,
humorously suggested this. On returning to
camp we passed Herr Schumann’s zareeba, and told
him what we had witnessed, asking him the meaning
of it all. He narrated the following tale of blood:
The day before our arrival at Heikota, when we
were in the immediate neighbourhood, probably
about the time we were encamping, a number of
the Basé people from the village of Sarcella had
come upon the children of the Beni-Amirs driving
the flocks and herds in for the night. They then
perpetrated a deed which makes one shudder to
think of, for they were not satisfied with simply
slaughtering these unoffending children, but doing so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
in a most horrible manner; in short, they ripped
them open with their knives, and drove off about
2,000 head of cattle. In consequence of this the
Sheik had given the word to his men to prepare
for action, and they were now doing so, intending to
make an attack on the village of Sarcella in the
morning.</p>

<p>In the evening we had a champagne dinner; the
Sheik studiously avoided the champagne, and had
the shocking bad taste to prefer raspberry vinegar
and water. Herr Schumann also joined us, but, like
a Christian, partook of champagne.</p>

<p>We pretended not to know anything of this
slaughtering business, so asked the Sheik what was
the reason of all the commotion amongst the tribe.
He related the same story, adding that he should
get his men together in the morning and attack
these Basé (that means kill all they could lay their
hands on) and get his cattle back again. How ably
he carried out his destructive intentions I will tell
the reader later on. The customs are somewhat
peculiar in this part of the world. Supposing I
and my party, who are not Beni-Amirs, enter the
Basé country from the Beni-Amir tribe, and they
should be at enmity with them at that time, they
would regard us as enemies. Knowing this, we told
the Sheik we were very sorry this had occurred just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
now, as we intended to explore that country, and his
fighting might make it a very difficult, if not impossible
matter to do so. However, with the true
instincts of a gentleman sheik, he accommodated
himself to all parties, very readily acquiesced in our
views, and was good enough to postpone his bloodthirsty
intentions for a few days.</p>

<p>After dinner we chatted round the camp fire for
awhile, smoking the “calumet of peace,” to use a
Cooperian phrase, and retired to our different
tents to rest 9.30 p.m. The Sheik, ere he left us,
accepted an invitation to breakfast next day at 7 a.m.
If we are late birds in England, we are early ones
in the Soudan.</p>

<p>January 21st.—True to his appointment the
Sheik breakfasted with us this morning. He was
not only punctual, but he literally <em>did</em> breakfast;
there was no finiking and fiddling about with his
food, for he disposed of it in a most straightforward
manner. Imagine an opening in the pavement for
the reception of coals, and you have a pretty good
idea of the rapid disappearance of food down the
œsophagus of our friend. We commenced with
porridge and milk; a dish evidently highly appreciated
by the Sheik; then we had minced collops,
kippered herrings, gazelle, stewed kidneys, wild
honey, French jam and coffee, to all of which Sheik<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Ahmed did ample justice. After breakfast many
warriors drop into camp, and, in their fashion,
squat round in a circle on their haunches. One of
the spears was covered with leather as a sign that
they were at peace with us. A great and long pow-wow
ensued as to our future journey; we should
want to buy or hire camels for going through the
Basé country, as those we had hired at Kassala
would have to return from Heikota.</p>

<p>Last night we were rather disturbed by the noise
of lions, and this morning, within about a dozen
yards of my tent, I found their footprints, fortunately
outside the zareeba. I dare say I spent about
an hour or so at my tent this morning attending to
a large number of natives, and afterwards visited
others in their own tents on the river-bed. In some
instances I was obliged to crawl in on my hands and
knees. When I had finished my morning’s work I
took up my shot gun and strolled off in quest of
some beautifully plumaged birds which were abundant
here and brought home an eagle, paroquet,
laughing-bird, falcon, and shreik, which I skinned
after luncheon.</p>

<p>We again invited Sheik Ahmed and Herr Schumann
to join us at the festive board at 7 p.m.; we
also told the former to let his people know that at
about 8.30 p.m. there would be what they call a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
<em>fantasia</em>. Just before 7 p.m. the Sheik arrived
and behaved himself in quite a gentlemanly manner.
He was dressed in spotless white, and was so particular
as to borrow a pen-knife from me to clean
his nails with (a great instance of the civilizing
effect of Englishmen). Although we drank iced
champagne and claret, he stuck to raspberry vinegar
and water, which he consumed with great relish.
He was rather clumsy with a knife and fork; indeed,
almost the only breach of manners that he perpetrated
was to finish up the repast (just before coffee
was brought) by plunging the teaspoon into the
preserve, scooping out as much as it would conveniently
hold, conveying it to his mouth and replacing
the spoon in the preserve; this mode of
eating has its inconveniences.</p>

<p>Another peculiarity of his was a singular habit
that one requires to get thoroughly accustomed to
to really appreciate; he generally indulged in it largely
at meal times when conversing, and having his face
directed to the object of attack. I scarcely know
how to describe it, and perhaps ought not to do so
in polite society, but that I wish to tell my readers
exactly what kind of a man this was. It was a
method (not unfamiliar even to English ears) of producing
a peculiar vibration or concussion of the
atmosphere by a noise proceeding from the mouth;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
some polite people would call it an eructation, but
that is not sufficiently explanatory. It is familiarly
and vulgarly known as “belching,” and so frequently
did it occur at meal times that it became known
amongst ourselves as “the genial belch of the
Sheik.” I suggested that probably it was a complimentary
proceeding on his part, but I must say if
it was so we could readily have forgiven this <em>too</em>
frequent formality. After dinner a great many of
his people assembled (no women, and very few children)
to witness the mysteries and wonders of the
magic lantern, or <em>fantasia</em>. Would that I had the
pencil of an artist to delineate the picture which the
<cite>Graphic</cite> or any other illustrated paper would have
been glad to have reproduced. Here we were encamped
in equatorial Africa; we had five tents
pitched amongst waving dhoum palms, tamarisk,
and tamarind, nebbuck, baobob, hegleek, ebony, and
other trees, and the usual luxuriant growth of tall
grass and young palms. About three hundred of these
dusky-skinned, almost black, agile-looking fellows,
wearing simply the tope or loin-cloth, the foremost
squatting on their haunches, the rest standing behind,
the Europeans in white clothing, and the picturesquely-dressed
Sheik in his white turban and robes.
It was a weird, wild scene, when viewed by the flickering
light of the lanterns as they moved about the camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
but when the moon shone out, shedding a soft, bright
light on the scene, it certainly was a most charming
and interesting picture. Amidst it all could be seen
three hundred glittering spear-heads, making the
picture complete. How easily, had they been so
disposed, could these wild sons of the Soudan have
made an end of us, but I am happy to say this ceremony
was not included in the evening’s programme.
We placed a wet sheet across the entrance to one of
the bell-tents, and as the Queen (whom they called
the Sultana) the Prince and Princess of Wales, the
elephant, lion, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, giraffe,
ostrich, crocodile (snapping his jaws together), and
other animals with which they were familiar, appeared
on the canvas, the delight of these grown-up children
was manifested by loud expressions of approval.
When the Sheik, his retinue and people took their
departure, we further astonished them by letting off
rockets and illuminating their way with red and blue
fire. If I went out there again I should certainly
take out a galvanic battery, which I am sure would
astonish and amuse immensely. We here engaged
fresh camel-men, huntsmen, horse-boys, and servants,
at rather high wages, on account of the
rumoured ferocious character of the Basé, the Sheik
taking a pretty good share of the wages himself.
All camels were bought, not hired; when we wanted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
to hire we were cheerfully assured by the owners
that we should very likely all be killed by the Basé
or Kunama people, and they would lose their camels.
The Sheik was presented with a capital bell-tent, a
rifle, and a good musical-box, which played six airs,
others, with razors, butchers’ knives in sheaths, topes,
beads, knives, scissors, small portable looking-glasses,
&amp;c., all of which were productive of great wonder
and joy. Sheik Ahmed, in return, sent us a present
of ten sheep and ten milk-giving goats, so that now
we had sixteen goats, which furnished us with plenty
of milk every morning to our porridge. As we intended
resuming our journey on the morrow, we
were all busy writing letters to England, which Herr
Schumann engaged to forward to Kassala.</p>

<p>PATIENTS AT HEIKOTA—LEAVE HEIKOTA—GAME IN THE BASÉ
COUNTRY—SEE OUR FIRST LION—A LION INTERVIEWS THE
AUTHOR—TETÉL, NELLUT, AND OTHER GAME KILLED ON
THE MARCH.</p>

</div>

<p>On the 22nd January we were up in good time, as
there was a good deal to be seen to ere we continued
our march. We intended to return to Heikota after
exploring the Basé country, which we thought would
occupy about four or five weeks. It would not,
therefore, be necessary to take all our baggage with
us; accordingly, a considerable quantity was left
behind in Herr Schumann’s zareeba until our return—assuming
that we should do so. I was, as usual,
busily occupied after breakfast in attending to my
patients, who not only came from close by, but from
long distances on camels. It had got noised abroad
from Kassala that there was a “Hakeem Ingelese”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
travelling with these gentlemen, and whenever we
encamped anywhere for a day or two many patients
came to visit me. They appeared inordinately fond of
my pills, and would swallow them with as much
avidity as boys in our country swallow lollipops.
To judge from what was expected of me, they must
have thought that I was endowed with almost supernatural
powers. One boy was brought to me whose
hip had been dislocated a year or so before; another
person who had been positively blind from ophthalmia
two years, hoped I could let in a stream of welcome
light: Alas! poor fellow, I could not make
the blind see, or the lame walk, under such circumstances.
However, I was often able to effect cures
in some and relief in other cases, and when we
returned to Heikota many grateful patients came to
thank me; one would give me some dhurra, another
a skin of milk, an Arab knife, a spear, a sheep, and
so on. Gratitude even is pleasing to a doctor,
although sometimes a scarce commodity. We did
not succeed in making a start until 4 p.m.; halted
at six. The Sheik, who came part way with us,
on returning to his tribe, said he would join us
in the morning, and see us well on the way ere
he interviewed the Basé at Sarcella, whom he
had an account to settle with. During our various
conversations with him he informed us that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
should find abundance of shooting of every kind in
the country—elephants, lions, leopards, porcupines,
wild cats, hyænas, buffaloes, jackals, giraffes, ostriches,
rhinoceros, antelopes of different kinds, gazelles,
oterops, ariels, maarifs, mehedehét, tetél, nellut, dick-dick,
baboons and monkeys; all kinds of birds; falcons,
Egyptian hawks, rollo-birds, paroquets, eagles,
vultures, doves, quail, partridges, sand-grouse,
guinea-fowl, and I don’t know what besides—all of
which was quite true; there was really enough of
shooting of every description to satisfy the most
ardent sportsman. He also advised us, when we got
into the Basé country, not to have our guns, rifles,
and revolvers in cases, but ready at a moment’s
notice, night and day, and this advice we strictly
followed during the whole of our journey.</p>

<p>On the 23rd we marched nine hours, encamping
at a place called Toodlook. Our sleep was rather
disturbed in the night by the noise of lions and
hyænas, which came very near the camp. We
marched to-day through varied scenery and pretty
country—now along the Mareb, then for two hours
across country, through jungle, again coming on to
the Mareb, across it, and over a plain studded with
trees and shrubs, finally encamping by the side of
the Mareb. Whilst our tents were being pitched,
Messrs. A. and W. James and I reconnoitred, soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
coming near to a place where there was some water.
Suddenly we discovered, about two hundred yards
from us, a fine lion lying down on a little elevated
land, no doubt on the look-out for some unsuspecting
antelope coming to drink. Mr. A. James ran
back to camp for his rifle, crept up, without arousing
the suspicion of the noble beast, and fired, but not
being near enough, missed him. The lion simply
got up and calmly turned off into the jungle, where
it was deemed unadvisable to follow him. On our
way back to camp we saw one place where there had
evidently been a desperate struggle between a lion
and his prey; the former evidently had the best of
it, as we saw a long trail, he having dragged his
supper into some long grass and young palms.</p>

<p>On the 25th we were up and off in good time,
leaving Suleiman and the English servants to follow
in charge of the caravan. Last night a rather
curious adventure occurred to me, which might have
had a curious termination. When we arrived at a
camping-ground I usually selected the spot for my
tent, quite regardless of where the others were going
to be pitched. On this occasion I had done so, and
ordered it to be pitched under some trees close to
young palms and tall grass, some distance from
the others. Suleiman remonstrated with me for
doing so, saying that the Basé or lions might come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
down in the night. However I would have it so.
Every day whilst we dined a large camp-fire was
lighted, as the nights were very chilly, although the
heat was so great in the daytime. Around this we
smoked and chatted over politics, English friends
and the events of the day, and plans for the future,
skinned birds or animals, wrote letters, or posted up
diaries. At half-past nine or ten o’clock we gradually
melted away one by one to bed. On this night
I was the last, having stayed to have an extra pipe.
At last I lighted my lantern, was walking off to, and
had nearly reached, my tent, when I was startled by
a low growl issuing from a thick growth of young
palms, about a dozen yards from my tent; there was
no mistaking the nature of the growl, and I rapidly
executed a retrograde movement, poked my head
into the nearest tent, calling out to the semi-sleeping
occupants thereof, “I say, did you hear that
salutation just as I was going to my tent?” Answer
by Mr. F. L. James and Mr. Phillipps, “No; what
was it, doctor? We were just going to sleep.” “Why,
it is a lion close to my tent, and there is no mistaking
it.” They laughed immensely, and seemed to
think it a good joke, but jumped up and came with
me towards my tent, I think slightly incredulous.
Their incredulity was, at all events, quickly dispelled,
as the lion, by another louder expression of opinion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
gave us distinctly to understand that he was not only
in unpleasant proximity to, but had his eye on us.
Again an <em>extremely</em> rapid retrograde movement by
the trio ensued, and a joking remark from Lort
Phillipps, “Doctor, you will be dragged off to-night,
as sure as fate,” and a consoling remark from Mr. F.
James that the lion was perhaps hungry. We seized
some burning brands from the fire, and piled on a
large number of dried palm leaves in front of my
tent. I then retired to rest in peace, and when I arose
in the morning my friends were, I hope, pleased to
find I was not in pieces. We heard both lions and
panthers in the night pretty near to us, but so long
as they did not visit the camp we did not care. In
the morning at breakfast the Sheik was highly
amused by an account of my night’s experience, and
extremely jocular over it. This day we killed two
tetél on the march, and caught fifty-seven sand-grouse
in a net, but only kept sufficient for dinner
and luncheon. One of our courses at dinner was
an omelette of ostrich eggs.</p>

</div>

<p>From January 26th to 28th nothing of importance
took place. A day seldom passed without
nellut, tetél, and gazelle falling to someone’s rifle.
We were all busy during leisure hours in writing
letters for England, as we should not be able to do
so or receive any again until our return from the
Basé country to Herr Schumann’s zareeba, where
Mr. James had arranged all letters and papers from
Kassala were to be brought. We often saw baboons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
gambolling about, also tracks of elephants, lions,
and panthers. The Shiek says we are now in the
neighbourhood of giraffes, ostriches, and buffalos.
This day he leaves us to fight or come to terms
with the Basé, and graciously condescends to act as
our postman as far as Heikota, promising to see
that our letters are forwarded from there to Kassala.
He tells us that his men are at Sarcella, where they
have about 1,000 of the offending Basé shut up in
a cave; they were now waiting for him ere they
took any further action. What transpired we did
not learn until we returned to Heikota. That I
will describe when we return there.</p>

<p>January 29th.—We are now in Basé territory.
We have for days past done with caravan routes or
paths, and travel over rocky mountains, large
plains, jungle, river-beds, and through a forest of
tamarind, tamarisk, palm, baobob, nebbuck, hegleek,
and mimosa trees. On the branches of the latter
we frequently saw lumps of gum arabic, as large as
walnuts, which had exuded through the bark.</p>

<p>At 4 p.m. we saw a Basé village on fire, and
rightly surmised, as we found out afterwards, that
the Beni-Amirs had been the authors of this. Just
after breakfast, before the camels were brought,
we shot eight partridges and ten quail, which were
handed over to the cook. Some were prepared for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
dinner, and some for luncheon next day. We
also shot on the march a buck tetél; the prime bit
was, of course, reserved for our dinner, and was
more like roast beef than the flesh of any other
animal I tasted; the rest was given to our attendants.
We encamped by the side of the river-bed,
where we found water on digging to the depth of 7
or 8 feet. Ere we could encamp we had to set to
with axes and clear away a number of young palms
and mimosa bushes, make a zareeba, and before
retiring for the night look to our rifles and revolvers
and see that we had plenty of cartridges ready in
case of emergency, as we flattered ourselves that we
were like the Bristol, Sheffield, or any other boys in
England who slept with one eye open. At all events
we had heard sufficient of this country to know that
it would be unwise for us to be caught napping,
especially as we noticed some of the natives spying
about soon after we had pitched our tents. About
mid-day we sighted the village of Sarcella, the inhabitants
of which Sheik Ahmed had gone to interview,
and whom Suleiman designated as “a very bad
peoples.” There is very little doubt that Suleiman
was right, if all we heard about them was true, for
in 1869 or ’70—I am not sure which—Mr. Powell,
wife, little boy, and all the Europeans were spitted
on their long spears. They now lie buried in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Bassaleg churchyard, near Newport, having been
brought home by his brother, Mr. Powell, M.P.,
who fearfully avenged his brother’s death. Whilst
I was in the Soudan I saw by a newspaper which
we got, that this gentleman lost his life in a
balloon.</p>

<p>January 30th.—Made a short march to-day,
namely, from 10.30 a.m. until 4.30 p.m., encamping
at a place called Wo-amma, playfully christened
and ever afterwards known as “Whoa Emma.”
The country was to-day very mountainous and
difficult for the caravan, to say nothing of ourselves.
I distinctly recollect that on this very day, whilst
travelling along a plane, one of the horse-boys came
trotting quickly along, causing my camel not only
to shy, but to bolt when I was quite unprepared for
any such <i lang="fr">contretemps</i>. A spectator would, doubtless,
have been much amused. I was not. For the
space of about 20 yards I bounded like an india-rubber
ball on the makloufa; then came suddenly
to grief from my lofty elevation, the distance from
the camel’s hump to his feet being considerable. I
fell with a regular bang on to my hip, which felt
very painful for some days afterwards, and had the
mortification to see my belongings gradually parting
company with the camel—my rug, then my satchel,
a basket, zanzimeer, &amp;c. The camel was caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
after some trouble, whilst I and they were gradually
picked up, I with rage in my heart, for this camel,
being a bolter, had served me several scurvy tricks
before; for instance, if we came to any little
declivity, the beast would persist in making a trot
of it, greatly exciting my apprehensions. Again,
when we came to a narrow pathway I would duck
my head where there were overhanging boughs of
prickly shrubs; he, thinking I was going to thrash
him, would at once bolt, and when he had rushed
through I should find my head and hands were like
a pincushion. I could then knock my helmet out of
the trees and at my leisure pick out the horrid
thorns with which my head and hands abounded.
Once I was nearly swept off the wretched beast as
he bolted in this way. A strong chain of cactus
was across our way, catching me in the middle. I
saw the danger in time, and clutched hold of the
makloufa with all my might, on I might have been
found suspended amongst the trees. It broke, fortunately,
and I escaped, but I never shall forget
how angry that camel frequently made me, what self-restraint
I was obliged to exercise, for if I chastised
him he would bellow and bolt again, to my great
danger and annoyance. I had in England extracted
many human teeth in my time, but this day I
extracted an elephant’s tooth, and brought it home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
as a curiosity. However, I think I ought to say
the elephant was not alive, and that on the
march we passed the skeletons of two others,
which, I have no doubt, furnished some excellent
repasts for the natives. These were not all we
passed calling for notice, for some of our men
came upon two of the Basé people; the first
sample of these curiosities we had seen. One was
in a baobob tree gathering the pods and throwing
them down to the other, who was collecting them in
a basket. These so-called ferocious savages appeared
terribly alarmed when our men came upon
them. The one on <i lang="la">terra firma</i>, with the true instinct
that “self-preservation is the first law of
nature,” bolted like a shot, but our men captured
him. The other was afraid to come down until
one of the English servants discharged the contents
of one barrel of his rifle, and let him know by the
aid of Beyrumfi, our interpreter, that the contents
of the other would be lodged in his frail tenement
of clay unless he was more sociable. This persuasive
kind of argument appeared very effective, for down
he came, and I am sure both he and his companion,
who, doubtless, were accustomed to be hunted like
wild beasts, were agreeably surprised when they
each received a pocket-knife and a bit of bread and
meat. Remembering the injunctions of Sheik<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Ahmed, and with Powell on the brain, we took
precautions against surprises—set to work and
made a zareeba round the camp, lighted camp fires,
and looked well to rifles and revolvers. The latter
we kept under our pillows; the former at the heads
of our beds, ready at a moment’s notice. Sentries
were posted, and occasionally relieved, whilst one
of us (whoever chanced to awake) went round to
see that they were doing their duty. The man
who was not, felt unhappy next morning, as he
received an intimation from the coorbatch before
breakfast that there had been a certain dereliction
of duty on his part.</p>

<p>January 31st.—We marched eight hours to-day,
encamping at Fodie on the dry river-bed, close to
some wells. This was a very fatiguing march for
the caravan, on account of our luggage, which was
much obstructed by trees. We travelled through
quite a forest of these. Where there were no trees
the grass had been burnt for miles round. Many
quail and sand-grouse were shot to-day.</p>

<p>February 1st.—After a short march of four hours
only, we encamped on the broad, sandy river-bed of
the Mareb, very near to the village of Koolookoo,
which we could see high up amongst the rocks of a
mountain on the opposite side. Each side of the
Mareb was plentifully lined with overhanging trees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
of all kinds, and amongst the twigs of some could be
seen many hundreds of the beautifully constructed
nests of the weaver-bird. Not very far from the
Mareb, at the base of the mountain, in which these
Basé at Koolookoo lived, were the remains of a mud
house in which Mr. Powell had once lived. This was,
I believe, as far, or nearly so, as he had penetrated.</p>

<p>The Kunama, or Basé country, is quite a <i lang="la">terra
incognita</i>, and, as far as we could ascertain, we are
the first and only Europeans who have explored
that country at all. This being so, I shall expend
a good deal of time in saying all I can about this
country and people. We shall have to thank
Messrs. W. D. James and Percy Aylmer for a map
of that country, and also for some photographs of
the people and scenery, which will be found in Mr.
F. L. James’s book. This book I have not yet
read, and shall not do so until my own is in the
publisher’s hands, for fear I may unwittingly adopt
any of his theories or expressions, but rather prefer
to be perfectly independent of it, and give <em>my own</em>
ideas and description in my own way, be they
good, bad, or indifferent. No two men agree
on any subject, and it is <em>very</em> probable that Mr.
F. L. James and I may materially differ on
<em>many</em>. So that I shall not be termed a copyist,
I shall neither reproduce the map or photographs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
but trust to sketches taken to the best of my
poor ability, but which, I hope, will convey a
pretty good idea of the kind of place and people that
we sojourned amongst for a while. Very well, then,
after this exordium—probably the longest I shall
make—I will continue my narrative, as the dog
would say of his caudal appendage.</p>

<p>This was the first Basé village we had come
to, and ere we could go any further it was necessary
that we should interview the Shiek of this
village, and explain the object of our visit. We made
an ostentatious display of our rifles and guns, twenty-four
in number, and placed them against the bank
ready for immediate use if necessary, whilst each of
us sported a six-chambered revolver in our waist-belts.
When we had—as we thought—taken sufficient
precautions against surprises or treachery, we
were curious to see these much-dreaded savages,
whom report said were capable of any sanguinary
deed (could, in fact, murder with a smiling face), and
although their neighbours lived on their borders,
they appeared to know little more about them than
we did ourselves. Whilst we lunched within easy
reach of our rifles, we sent forth one Beyrumfi, “our
guide, philosopher, and friend” (and the only man
who knew anything of the language) to the village.
When we had finished our luncheon, we got our field-glasses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and on the very summit of the rocky mountain
we saw all the women and children, and a few
of the men, looking down on us. Half an hour afterwards,
winding round by a circuitous pathway, on
sloping ground, and occasionally hidden by trees, we
could now see Beyrumfi, accompanied by seven or
eight of the Basé, each carrying his spear and shield.
When they appeared on the edge of the river-bed in
single file, headed by Beyrumfi, the Sheik’s son (a
fine, strapping, well-made fellow, who took his
father’s place during his absence) dropped his shield,
and, without stopping, drove his spear quivering into
the sand; his example was followed by all the others.
They all marched briskly across the river-bed, whilst
we, in our English fashion, stood up and shook hands
all round, which, under such circumstances, was
much more agreeable than kissing all round. Sheik
junior, if I may call him so, was about 5ft. 10in. in
height, as straight as a dart, and not by any means
over-dressed, for he wore nothing but a bit of soft
leather, very much the shape and size of a man’s
bathing drawers. He got the twig of a tree and
broke it with us as a sign of friendship. All then
squatted round on their haunches, with their knees
under their chins (their customary mode of resting
themselves), and Beyrumfi explained the object of
our visit. This was satisfactory. The Sheik then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
borrowed a two-edged sword from Beyrumfi, placed
it on the ground with the point directed towards us,
put his <em>naked</em> foot on it, and delivered a short
harangue, the purport of which was that we were in
his country now, and as long as we remained neither
he nor his people would harm, but do all they could
to assist us, and that we were now his brothers.
However, he could really only speak for his village.
This is what is called making “Aman”—that is,
swearing peace and friendship, and that we will trust
one another; but we didn’t. On hospitable thoughts
intent, we ordered a large bowl of cooked meat; our
new acquaintances soon squatted round, and judging
from the rapid disappearance of the food, I
should imagine that a larger bowl would have done
very well. We gave each of these fellows small
presents, amongst other things an empty claret
bottle each, which was much prized, but to the
Sheik’s son we gave a few extra things, such as a
tope or loin-cloth, a razor, a knife in sheath, needles,
pins and thread, a velvet necklet, and a waistcoat
striped yellow and black. He at once invested himself
with the order of the tope and yellow and black
waistcoat, to the great admiration of his friends, who
continually made a clucking noise with the mouth,
just as we do to urge on a horse; from their point
of view it meant how wonderful, how nice, and what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
a swell you are. The claret-coloured lead-capping
of bottles, which had been thrown on the ground,
they gathered up, using them to decorate their hair
with, or as an addition to their necklaces. Our rifles
and guns were still leaning against the bank, just to
show how well armed we were. Now, finding the
natives were so friendly, and that they had left their
spears on the other side of the river-bed, we ordered
our rifles to be taken into our tents; still, however,
retaining our revolvers. Of course a long pow-wow
ensued. Whilst this was going on the women and
children were not idle in the village, for they stood
out on various places of vantage, looking down on
their braves. We lent the Basé field-glasses to look
at them, and it was most amusing to hear their expressions
of surprise, with any amount of the clucking
accompaniment, as they saw how near the glass
brought their friends to view. After a while they
returned to their village, upon which several of their
friends, finding not only that we appeared reasonable
beings, but that we had given several presents,
paid us a visit, no doubt hoping that we would serve
them in the same way. Of course the wonderful
Ingelese exhibited to all these visitors their rifles
and revolvers, accompanied by an elaborate explanation
of their killing powers. Beyrumfi explained all
this amidst a shower of cluckings. We had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
told by Sheik Ahmed that the Basé were no better
than beasts, that they lived in holes in the ground
and in caves; we resolved to see for ourselves, and
so told the Sheik that we would pay him a visit on
the morrow, which we did. They don’t absolutely
live in holes in the ground like rabbits, but where
the rocks lean against one another, or project out,
forming an awning, they utilize these accidents to
convert such a place into a dwelling; they also have
many well-made huts. In these particulars they
differ from wild beasts, but I think in most other
particulars they very much resemble them. As for
their being the ferocious savages represented to us,
I must say that they appeared more afraid of us
than we were of them. I formed an idea that they
had a cowed, hunted look, and well they may have,
as the Egyptians squeeze all they can out of them
on one side, and the Abyssinians on the other, and
the reason they live in such places amongst rocks
difficult of access is that if attacked, they can roll
these rocks down on their assailants. The attire of
both men and women is extremely simple and
scanty. The women wear a short skirt reaching from
the waist to the knees, most of them a large ring
in one nostril. Many of them are not bad looking;
their black hair is not profuse, but inclined to be
frizzly; this is plaited down, whilst bits of metal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
brass rings or beads, are frequently interlaced. All
have lovely teeth. In stature they are rather short
and when young possess rather graceful, well-formed
figures. Either beads, metal, or some other ornament
surrounds the neck, the arm, just above the
elbow, the wrists and ankles. Very many, both
men and women (the Arabs as well), have the scars
of burns about the size of a shilling. I do not know
whether it is so in all cases, but in very many, if they
are in pain in any part of the body, they apply a hot
iron button (technically known as the actual cautery).
A very common custom is to decorate the chest,
abdomen, and back (sometimes one of these, sometimes
all of them) with a series of little cuts, into
which a dye called kohl is rubbed in. Kohl is also,
much used by the Basé to stain their eyelids all
round, which produces a bluish-black stain. Whilst
speaking of this dye, I may say that it is supposed
this was the very thing which Jezebel used to improve
her personal appearance. The difference between
the Basé men and women in the matter of
dress and ornaments is that the men, instead of a
short tope or skirt, wear a bit of thin leather round
their loins (like a rather scant pair of bathing
drawers), and a scratcher in their hair. I saw some
moderately big boys attired in the most inexpensive
suit conceivable; namely, an anklet and bracelet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
metal, and a bit of a porcupine’s quill in the left
nostril.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, the men are well-formed,
agile-looking fellows. These Basé people are quite
hemmed in in their small country, on the one hand
by the Abyssinians and on the other sides by different
tribes of Arabs, with whom they appear to have
little or no communication or dealings, and if they
venture out of their own country they are hunted
down by the Arabs just like wild animals. The
Arabs of the Soudan are darker than the Abyssinians,
but the Basé are much darker than the Arabs
and speak a different language. The Basé are quite
a different race to their neighbours, and more nearly
approach the negro type. They are blacker than
the Arabs, but not the coal-black of the negro; their
hair is shorter, more crisp and woolly, than the Arabs,
but not the absolute wool of the negro. The Arabs
have good regular features, lips and noses like our
own; the Basé are the contrary, and more resemble
the negro in this respect and their high cheek-bones,
but they are not nearly so pronounced as the negro.
Their foreheads, as a rule, are rather narrow and
receding. I was obliged perforce to depend on
Sheik Ahmed, and more particularly on Beyrumfi,
for all the information I could glean respecting these
people. They say they have no religion. Sheik<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Ahmed, speaking very contemptuously of them,
says “that they have a rain-maker who promises
rain, when it is pretty sure to come; but if he makes
several promises and the rain does not come, he
goes”—to that bourne from whence no traveller
shall return. In the little matter of marriage, their
laws and ceremonies are extremely simple, for they
marry their sisters, their daughters, their cousins,
and their aunts, possibly their mothers and grandmothers.
Courtship is brief and primitive. A Basé
man fancies a Basé girl (presumably not his own
daughter); he tells the nearest male relatives so,
father or brother—good; he then presents him with
a few yards of calico or some skins, the same also to
his bride, and she becomes his.</p>

<p>Now with regard to their diet. I cannot help
thinking that this admits of considerable improvement.
As they are not possessed of large flocks
and herds like their neighbours, the Beni-Amirs, they
have not much milk or meat, neither have they so
much dhurra as an article of diet. They obtain
meat occasionally when they can ensnare an animal;
the <em>kind</em> of meat is rather a secondary consideration
for they will eat the meat of lion, panther, elephant
monkeys, lizards, or giraffes with as much gusto as
that of antelope or buffalo. They are not so particular,
either, as they ought to be, for they consume all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
except the skin and bones. They also eat the roots
of young palm trees, the outer covering of the
dhoum palm nut, nebbuck, and hegleek nuts, the
fruit of the baobob, wild honey, and a certain, or
rather an uncertain, quantity of milk and dhurra.
They do not indulge in baked baby, and I am quite
sure that their carnal longings are never satiated
with cold or roast missionary, as there are no missionaries
there, but it has occurred to me that this
place is virgin soil for missionary enterprise, as
there does not appear to be any religion that requires
eradicating from their minds.</p>

<p>In the evening of the 2nd February a dirty-looking
old fellow (a sheik from Aidaro), paid us a visit,
bringing with him a gourd of wild honey as a peace
offering, made “aman” with us, and of course
received his presents.</p>

<p>I was much struck when visiting the village with
their beautifully made baskets; so closely woven are
they as to enable them to carry milk or water in
them without a drop oozing through.</p>

<p>On the 3rd February we made a further advance,
starting at 11 a.m., and encamping at 4 p.m., again
on the river-bed, at Aibara. This day we marched
for the space of five hours through a forest; the
heat was very great, and the ground over which we
travelled was full of large, deep cracks, often two or
three inches wide, caused by the contraction of the
earth, which had been subjected to a continuous
baking by the hot sun since the rainy season. Oftentimes
could be seen the great footprint of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
elephant, now quite a moulded one, having been
there since the rainy season. On leaving Koolookoo
we were accompanied by about 80 or 100 of the
inhabitants, having nothing with them but spear
and shield. We knew what this meant—that we
should have to provide them with food—a rather
large undertaking considering that our own party,
including camel-men, horse-boys, and servants,
numbered about 40 or 50. Accordingly a delicate
hint was conveyed to our new body-guard, that our
own people would first of all have to be provided
with food; then if there was plenty of meat to spare
they would be quite welcome to it. To this arrangement
they amiably acceded. On <i lang="la">terra firma</i> we
could have made a good stand with our rifles and
revolvers in case of attack, but had these Basé
thought proper, at a preconcerted signal, to make
an onslaught on our long straggling caravan, I am
afraid we should have fared very badly, notwithstanding
our being well armed. However, I think
their principal reason for coming with us was to
have a continual feast of meat, an article of diet
they were capable of stowing away as capaciously
as a lion would do, and with as little ceremony. In
the evening three sheiks paid us a visit, each going
through the ceremony of “aman.” After dinner
the magic lantern was exhibited, and this excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
their astonishment even more than it did that of
the Beni-Amirs. I do not intend to go into a
description much of hunting-scenes, as they would
occupy too much space, and I do not think that the
frequent repetition of such scenes would be interesting
to the generality of my readers; besides which I
have no doubt Mr. F. L. James has done this in his
book. Suffice it to say that as there was abundance
of game of every description, scarcely a day passed
without plenty being brought into camp.</p>

<p>February 4th.—Off at 10.30 a.m., halt at 5 p.m.;
pitch tents at Maissasser, on the bank of the Mareb,
and quite close to jungle. About 12 o’clock, as our
camels were slowly winding along the bed of the
Mareb, a grand bull buffalo, an enormous beast,
dashed right across in front of us, raising quite a
cloud of dust. This was the first buffalo we had
seen; at half-past 4 p.m. we saw three more, and
just afterwards a giraffe. There was a good deal of
chuckling now at the prospect of sport in store, and
we resolved to encamp here for the next two or
three days. To-day we saw miles of country on
fire. The country looks much greener in this
neighbourhood; trees and jungle abundant, and
water much nearer to the surface.</p>

<p>February 5th.—Last night, about 11 o’clock, just
as I had gone to sleep, I was considerably startled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
by several rifle shots, one after the other. In an
instant I was out of bed, rifle in hand, rushed out
of my tent in my slippers and night shirt, not
knowing what to think; the first idea naturally was
that we were being attacked. Messrs. F. L. James
and Phillipps, who slept in another tent, were also
out, clad in the same airy costume as myself, and, like
me, each with a rifle in his hand. All this was
the work of a minute—we had scarcely time
to say, “Whatever is the meaning of it all?”
when close behind my tent, amongst the thick
stems of the tall grass, there was a sound as
of a rushing mighty wind. This was enough; the
whole affair was explained at once; we knew
directly that this was nothing less than a herd
of buffalos, and I am very thankful that they just
avoided my tent, which could as easily have been
upset by them as a box of matches. It seems that
just after we had gone to bed, the others, Messrs.
Colvin, P. Aylmer, W. D. and A. James, “from information
received,” took their rifles (it was a bright
moonlight night) and stole out cautiously to the
edge of the jungle. There they saw a herd of
buffalos drinking, and into it they discharged their
rifles with pretty good effect, for about 11 o’clock
this morning one of the herd was found dead in the
jungle pretty near to camp. A camel was sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
the spot to bring home the quarters for food, and
the head, of course, as a trophy. A great number of
the Basé were pretty quickly on the spot; then there
ensued such a scene as I had never before witnessed,
and which almost baffles description. I will, however,
endeavour to describe it, as some of my
readers might like to be furnished with particulars.
Invalids, persons of delicate organization and others,
might, however, like to omit this little account of a
Basé feast, which I assure them will not have an
appetising effect. I may here say that there is not
the least occasion for me to draw on my imagination
and indulge in what some people facetiously call
“crackers,” which I have not and shall not do, as there
is no necessity for doing so, there being abundance
of material of a strictly veracious character which I
cull from my diary, written carefully down at the
time. Incredible as some accounts may appear, I
must ask my readers to accept these facts without
the usual formula <i lang="la">cum grano salis</i>. Very well, then,
I will write down, and you, reader, can read, mark,
and inwardly digest (if you please) <em>without</em> the usual
proverbial pinch of salt, a description of a scene
that I was an eye-witness of, and if I should somewhat
interfere with your enjoyment, when called
from labour to refreshment, don’t blame me, but
blame the Basé. All I can say is, that this is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
what incredulous people call “a traveller’s tale,”
but a “true story.” Do not say, “It strikes me
that he doth protest too much.”</p>

<p>I recollect to have seen somewhere or other a
pamphlet entitled “The Stomach and Its Trials.”
That useful organ in the human body of Basé does
not appear to be subject to usual inconveniences,
but accommodates itself to circumstances, not
unlike an india-rubber bag. The only trials I
saw them suffer was trying how much they could
stow away without causing a rupture of that
viscera.</p>

<p>Well, to continue. As soon as the animal was
opened they fell upon the intestines like hungry
wolves. Oh! such a scramble for tit-bits. There
were our dusky friends very soon ankle-deep in the
viscera, and about 20 pairs of hands clutching at
them. Two would perhaps get hold of the same
piece, and pull away like a couple of dogs, until a
knife produced a solution of continuity. Another
group could be seen hacking away at pieces of the
liver, and cramming the warm, quivering morsels
into their mouths. One could be seen stuffing a
lump of fat into his mouth with one hand, the other
at the same time would be industriously employed
in rubbing this adipose tissue into his hair. Another
appeared to have a predilection for kidneys; and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
this disgusting feast went on, until the whole interior
of the animal was consumed, without such absurd
preliminaries as cooking.</p>

<p>One would naturally suppose that I should be
busy at my medicine-chest next day, but not one of
them even so much as troubled me for a pill afterwards.
They might truly say, “We are fearfully
and wonderfully made;” and after this exhibition
of digestive powers, I should be obliged to coincide
with them. When they had gorged themselves like
boa-constrictors, I should not exaggerate if I said
that they presented a most filthy and disgusting
spectacle. Their proportions were quite aldermanic,
and their mouths, faces, and arms up to the
elbows were smeared with fat and gore. Had this
buffalo lived a month or two longer she would have
become a mother.</p>

<p>We do not consider very young veal wholesome,
but whether the Basé thought this <em>very</em> young
buffalo would be a delicacy they must not touch
I know not; at all events it was brought into camp.
We gave it the Basé, who appeared quite pleased.
In less than ten minutes afterwards we saw three
of them engaged in tearing it limb from limb, and
eating it without going through the formality of
cooking. The quarters of buffalo, senior, were
divided between our men and Basé; the hide was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
cut up into sections and given to the sheiks and
others to make into shields.</p>

<p>Messrs. Colvin and Aylmer shot to-day two
mehedehét. This is a very beautiful antelope,
possessing a very rough coat, a fine pair of horns,
slightly curved and annulated; is about 13 hands
high, and in colour much resembles the red deer.
Messrs. F. L. and W. James stalked an ostrich for
two hours, but did not succeed in bringing him down.</p>

<p>We were encamped on a little plateau by the
side of the Mareb, close to a great jungle. On the
opposite side of this wide river-bed were very many
trees of different kinds, and on both sides rocky
mountains. Just by our camp, on the sandy river-bed,
the Basé were encamped. Notwithstanding
their mid-day feast on the uncooked internals of the
buffalo, they were ready and willing for another
set to in the evening—this time of cooked meat.
Whether this second gorge had a stimulating and
intoxicating effect on them I don’t know, but just
as we were off to our various tents for the night,
at 9.30 p.m., we heard strange noises issuing from
the Basé camp. Messrs. A. James, Colvin, and I
were curious to ascertain the cause, so down we
went amongst them, and this is what we saw, and
what I have some difficulty in describing:—</p>

<p>All the Basé were engaged in a peculiar dance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
four or six abreast, and so close to each other as to
be almost touching; those behind always treading
in the footsteps of those in front, whilst each one
held his spear aloft at arm’s-length. What they
were saying I don’t exactly know, but it was a
dance of joy celebrating their feast of meat. A few
words as a solo would be sung, then all would join
in chorus. This went on for about half an hour;
then they broke up and went through a wild war-dance—now
flying forwards and darting out their
spears at an imaginary enemy whilst protecting
themselves with their shields, then nimbly retreating,
crouching and springing like wild cats. It
was a novel and singular spectacle to see nearly a
hundred of these black savages, with their glittering
spears, agile as monkeys, leaping in and out between
about 30 flickering fires on the river-bed. Like the
Pharisee of old, I could not help (mentally) exclaiming,
“Thank God I am not as these men are.”</p>

<p>I then retired to rest, and slept peacefully and
soundly until the following morning.</p>

<p>February 6th.—Soon after breakfast we saw,
stretched from tree to tree near the camp, what
appeared like clothes-lines with stockings suspended
on them to dry. The Basé had made ropes out of
the palm-leaves, and on these the meat which they
could not then dispose of hung in strips and festoons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to dry. When dried, they would stuff them into
gazelle skins, or bags of some kind, for future use.
To-day about 40 of them returned to Koolookoo,
well-charged with meat, both in their own skins and
that of gazelles; the rest remained with us.</p>

<p>This morning another buffalo, which was wounded
on the night of the 4th, was found, but not dead.
He, however, received his <i lang="fr">coup de grace</i> from Mr.
Colvin’s rifle, but not until he had made a furious
charge, though so badly wounded, fortunately without
any ill-results. A wounded buffalo is about as
dangerous and fierce an animal as can be met with,
and will charge most savagely if he is only within
five minutes of death, provided his limbs will support
him. We had plenty of meat brought into camp,
for in addition to this buffalo, two nellut, a mora,
and two buffalos were shot. Temperature at 1.30,
solar thermometer 150°, wet bulb 66°, dry bulb in
shade 90°.</p>

<p>This has been rather an exciting day, as Mr. W.
James saw and stalked three giraffes, but was not
successful in getting near enough for a shot. Sali,
the tracker, saw three ostriches and a rhinoceros,
the latter pretty close to him, and I two full-grown
elephants a distance off, but none of them were
bagged. No doubt had these elephants been
followed up for a day or so they could have been
got at, but they were not. Messrs. A. James and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
Colvin followed them up next day for many miles,
but not far enough.</p>

<p>February 7th.—Messrs. Colvin and A. James,
who went in quest of the two elephants, returned
about 4 p.m., without having seen them. In the
evening Hoodoo, chief sheik of the Basé, paid us a
visit, bringing with him a pot of wild honey as a
present. He went through the formality of making
“aman” with us, after which he squatted on his
haunches in the usual native fashion.</p>

<p>During a long pow-wow which ensued, I was
busy making mental notes of Hoodoo, not by any
means complimentary to that august personage.
He was a dirty-looking old fellow, as scantily
dressed as his colleagues, nearly black, with an ill-favoured,
sinister cast of countenance, and not by any
means a man whom I should place unbounded confidence
in. He received several presents, amongst
others a bernouse and a rather gorgeous-looking
abia (a cloak-looking kind of thing), with gold braid
ornamentation around the neck. He seemed mightily
pleased with these. He then joined his comrades’
camp, and we went to our dinner.</p>

<p>This was rather a nice camping-ground, but quite
unsheltered from the sun by trees. However, we
provided a shelter by cutting down some young
trees, fixing them in the ground and making a
covering of matting, tall grass, and palm leaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
which were obtainable close by. So great was the
heat now that the ink dried in my pen ere I could
write three lines on a page of foolscap. However,
I was fortunately provided with Mappin and Webb’s
stylographic pen, which is really invaluable in
such hot climates. Always about 12 or 1 o’clock
a slight breeze would spring up, producing occasionally
a very curious phenomenon. A very high
column of dust (perhaps half a mile in height)
would come whirling and waltzing along right
through the middle of the camp, and so long as
it was not hidden by trees or mountains I could
see it spinning on and on, looking in the distance
like a column of smoke. A good deal of sport
was obtained in this neighbourhood, chiefly buffalos
and antelopes of different kinds.</p>

<p>February 8th.—We struck our tents and were in
marching order by 11 a.m. After an easy journey
through some pretty good country, where vegetation
was abundant, we encamped at 3 p.m. on a nice bit
of land by the Mareb amongst many tall trees and
shrubs, which afforded a good shade. Here we
purposed remaining for a week at least, as big game
of all kinds was plentiful, and here for the first time
we found rhinoceros’ tracks. This place is called
Maiambasar, and is situated on the border of
Abyssinia. Water is near the surface here. During
the journey I have noticed that as we have got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
nearer to Abyssinia we have found the water nearer
the surface. We heard panthers, hyænas, and lions
last night near camp, but lions are not so plentiful
as they were a few days ago.</p>

<p>February 9th.—Abdullah, a black boy, who looks
after my camel, has been walking very lame during
the last few days, having considerable swelling at
the knee. I find he has a large abscess, produced
by a guinea-worm. He comes from Algeden, which
is about five days from here between Kassala and
Souheet. He says guinea-worm is very common
there and on the White Nile.</p>

<p>Strange to say, all returned to camp in the evening
without having obtained game of any kind,
although out all day. Mr. Aylmer, whilst in
search of game, suddenly came upon a rather
curious scene. There, on the mountain side, scarcely
sheltered from the burning rays of the sun, was
an old man suffering from leprosy, miles away,
apparently, from any human being or habitation.
Food and water had been placed near him, to which
he could help himself. Mr. Aylmer informed me
that the surrounding atmosphere was charged with
the stench arising from the decomposed food which
was scattered around the place. I should say that
most probably that old man furnished a meal for one
of the wild beasts ere long.</p>

<p>February 10th.—Two buffalos and two nellut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
killed this day. One, a bull buffalo, was an enormous
beast, and probably the hero of many a fight, for
one of his horns had been knocked short off, one
eye knocked out, whilst his forehead was covered
with scars—evidently a disreputable, cantankerous
old buffalo. His carcase was given to the Basé,
who were well pleased with the donation. The
Koolookoo Basé who came with us through the
country would, I daresay, have divided the meat
amicably between them, as their Sheik was with
them, but their number had been materially increased
by other Basé.</p>

<p>In the evening, during the division of the spoil,
just outside our camp, a great difference of opinion
prevailed as to <i lang="la">meum</i> and <i lang="la">tuum</i>. Knives, clubs,
spears, and staves were freely brandished amid a
chorus of yells and shouts, ending in a scramble for
the joints and pieces of meat. Some of them secured
a reasonable share, and trotted with it; others, again,
not so fortunate, would intercept a fugitive caressing,
perhaps, the thigh of the deceased buffalo. Then
a desperate struggle would ensue between them,
five or six pulling away in different directions.
Fortunately all was settled without bloodshed, peace
reigned in the camp, and we all retired to our respective
tents at a respectable hour.</p>

<p>February 11th, 1882, was the most memorable day
of the whole campaign. Thinking it was not safe to
leave the camp without protectors, Messrs. W. D.
and A. James and I remained in camp, whilst
Messrs. F. L. James and Colvin went out in one
direction and Phillipps and Aylmer in another, in
search of big game. Each party went out mounted
on ponies, which had been bought for the purpose
at Kassala and Heikota. Each party took
an agreegeer, or huntsman, a horse-boy, camel-boy,
and camel with them, the latter for the purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
carrying home the game. They started soon after
8 a.m., Messrs. Phillipps and Aylmer went in the
direction of some mountains on the Abyssinian
border, whilst Messrs. James and Colvin took the
opposite side of the Mareb. We amused ourselves
in camp in reading, writing letters, or posting up
diaries. Keeping my diary carefully and correctly
posted up day by day was a duty which I most
religiously attended to before ever I retired to rest,
however fatigued I may have been by the day’s
march. Incidents and impressions written down at
the time are more likely to be correct than if left to
memory. From my diary I quote the following
particulars:—</p>

<p>“About 1.30 p.m., just as we were about to sit
down to luncheon, Messrs. Aylmer and Phillipps came
into camp looking considerably chop-fallen and exhausted,
and having only one horse between them.
Of course we did not expect either party home until
5 or 6 p.m., so I said to Aylmer—</p>

<p>“‘Hallo! how is it you are back so soon, and
looking so precious serious?’</p>

<p>“‘I can tell you, doctor, this is no laughing
matter,’ said he, ‘for we have been attacked by the
Abyssinians or Dembelas, and very likely they will
soon be down on our camp.’</p>

<p>“This certainly did look a serious business,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
especially as we had no zareeba round the camp; so
I said—</p>

<p>“‘Well, the best thing we can do is to have our
luncheon at once; then we shall be more fit for
work.’”</p>

<p>The wisdom of this suggestion was apparent,
and at once acted upon. Whilst it was being
brought I strapped on my revolver, brought out
my diary and entered the above conversation.
Mahomet Sali and others were at once sent out as
scouts in search of Messrs. James and Colvin, with
a promise of five dollars each to those who brought
them into camp. We then sat down to luncheon,
and the following account was given of this affair,
and was duly entered in my diary immediately afterwards,
as we did not know when we might be attacked,
and I was desirous of leaving my diary
posted up complete to latest date.</p>

<p>Aylmer’s story:—“We had got about eight or
nine miles from camp on the sandy river-bed, quite
in a hollow, precipitous rocks and trees on each side
of us, when suddenly about 30 strangers, who turned
out to be Dembelas, appeared. We thought they
were Abyssinians, because they were so much lighter
in colour than Arabs, and, of course, quite different
in every respect from the Basé. Some of them
seized our hands and commenced kissing them profusely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
exclaiming ‘Aman, aman,’ at the same time
beckoning us to lay down our rifles. Now, although
we thought they were friendly, we did not think it
wise to be so confiding as this, until Mahomet, the
agreegeer (who, we supposed, knew more of the
customs of these people than we did), lay down his,
beckoning us to do the same, saying it would
be better to do so. One fellow, wearing a felt
hat, was more demonstrative even than the others.
Well, we followed Mahomet’s example; no sooner
had we done so (we had four rifles with us and
about 50 cartridges) than they were immediately
seized, and a struggle ensued for their possession.
The man wearing the felt hat seized a valuable
elephant rifle, vaulted on to the back of Mr.
Phillipps’s horse and galloped off. Attached to the
saddle of that horse was his revolver, a number
of cartridges, and a field-glass. The horse-boy
vanished like smoke, whilst his horse was taken
possession of by another of the enemy. They attempted
to spear the camel-boy, missed him and
speared the camel. Phillipps received a blow from
the butt-end of a rifle which would have prostrated
him had not his helmet protected his head.
He, however, turned round, closed with his assailant,
and succeeded in wrenching the rifle from
him. I pulled the trigger of my revolver, but on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
account of sand, which obstructed it, I could not
discharge it.</p>

<p>“In the hubbub which ensued Mahomet could
nowhere be seen, and about 8 or 10 Basé (who
had accompanied us, with the intention of having
a feast and cutting up the animal into quarters)
vanished at once. We were now alone, and by
this time there were about 100 yelling demons
brandishing their spears, whooping and leaping
about. Under such circumstances we thought discretion
the better part of valour, so we fled with
one horse between us, and have made the best of
our way to camp, riding and walking by turns.”</p>

<p>This really was very alarming news, and we quite
expected that we should soon be fully occupied in
defending ourselves from an attack.</p>

<p>We now resolved to fire the country all round
and construct a strong zareeba. Before I fell to
with the axe I once more sought out my diary and
chronicled the above. All then fell to with a will,
cutting down all the prickly trees in the neighbourhood,
dragging them round the camp and so forming
a very strong zareeba. This was no joke when
the solar thermometer registered about 150°, and the
heat was 100° in the shade.</p>

<p>Whilst we were thus employed the horse-boy
made his appearance, streaming with blood, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
flesh being torn by the cruel thorns as he rushed
blindly on. We now set fire to all the tall grass
and bushes in the neighbourhood. The terrific speed
with which it spread was surprising, miles of country
were soon in flames. The crackling of the grass and
trees resembled more than anything else the most
fierce hailstorm I ever saw.</p>

<p>Now the camel-boy turned up and this was his account
of the affair:—Just as he leaped off the camel
he saw Mahomet on the ground, whilst one of the
Dembelas darted his spear at him several times; then
left him writhing. He went to his assistance, and
helped him along some distance, whilst poor
Mahomet supported his intestines (which had
gushed out) in his tope. At last the poor fellow
sank down under a tree, saying—</p>

<p>“I can go no further; I shall soon die. Save
yourself; make haste to camp and tell the gentlemen
to make a strong zareeba at once as they
will certainly be attacked, probably to-night.”</p>

<p>By this time Messrs. F. James and Colvin, who
had been found by the scouts, arrived. We at once
held a council of war, and determined not only to go
in search of Mahomet, but to attack the Dembelas
if we could find them, leaving two of our company in
camp to command the men in case of attack. All
the neighbouring Basé, we found, had bolted—Elongi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the Sheik from Koolookoo, and his men, alone remained,
and promised to stand by us and fight for
us if necessary.</p>

<p>Our armoury consisted of about 22 shot-guns and
rifles, and about a dozen six-chambered revolvers.
All the camel-men and native servants were armed
with spear and shield. Having provided ourselves
each with rifle, revolver, and cartridges, our two
European servants; Suleiman, Ali, and Cheriff also;
we called up our native servants. To the most
trusty of these, including Beyrumfi, our guide,
Mahomet Sali, Sali, the tracker, and Ali Bacheet,
the head camel-man, we entrusted the remainder of
our firearms, but unfortunately most of them had to
be instructed in the use of them.</p>

<p>I provided myself with a few bandages, lint, and
my pocket case of surgical instruments, and feeling
that we were embarking on a very perilous enterprise,
left instructions respecting my immortal
diary, which would convey full information up to
the time of our departure from camp.</p>

<p>Just as we were getting into the saddle who
should turn up but the Chief Sheik, Hoodoo, who
left our last camping place the morning after his
arrival. He <em>appeared</em> surprised at all this commotion.
Whether he was really so or not I do not
know, but I am sure, from the very first, I did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
feel that I should repose in him the trustful confidence
of an innocent child.</p>

<p>Our little army consisted now of Messrs. F. L.
and A. James, Phillipps, Aylmer, myself, six of our
men with firearms, the Koolookoo Sheik, and 15 of
his men with spear and shield. We started off, on
what <em>might</em> prove to be our last journey, about 4
p.m. And I think we shall all remember that silent
ride of eight miles up the sandy river-bed of the
Mareb to Abyssinia, shaded often by trees which
thickly adorned the banks. We well knew, as we
approached Abyssinia, that each bush may conceal
an enemy, who might at any moment spring out on
us unawares, and knowing this, each one clutched
his rifle with a firm grip, ready for instant use, and
determined to sell his life dearly if the worst came
to the worst. I felt that our present position was
something like that of Fitz-James, when he held the
interesting conversation with Rhoderick Dhu which
Sir Walter Scott so graphically describes—</p>

</div>

<p>No one spoke above a whisper as we stole silently
and quickly on, until at last we arrived at the scene
of the scuffle.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Here, and in the neighbourhood, we searched
about for Mahomet or his assailants. We spent
two hours thus unsuccessfully, until darkness
warned us it was time to return to camp.</p>

</div>

<p>As we were returning, our attention was attracted
to a large baobob tree full of vultures. Sali and
Mahomet Sali thought we might find Mahomet’s
bones, picked clean by these foul birds, near the
tree. We, therefore, searched that neighbourhood,
but found him not.</p>

<p>Darkness had come on ere we had retraced our
way any distance, and we returned as silently as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
had advanced, keeping well on the alert until we
neared the camp.</p>

<div class="verse">Our camp fire close before us burned.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was about 10 p.m. by the time we got to
camp. Dinner was soon on the table. This we at
once discussed, also our plans for the next day.
The line of action determined on was this—sentries
were to be posted about the camp, and a few outside
to guard against surprise. These, again, would
be looked after by Suleiman. We should load up
in the morning, and return to our former camp,
first of all having another hunt for Mahomet. We
could not divest our minds of the idea that we
ought to attack these Dembelas if we could find
them, and thought that perhaps our dirty old friend
Hoodoo would assist us with some of the Basé.
Accordingly, whilst seated round the camp fire
after dinner, he was sounded on the matter, and
promised £100 if he would lend a 100 of his
people next morning. Hoodoo mentally said, “Hoo
dont.” As a cautious look stole over his black face
he raised his eyes from the camp fire for a moment,
stealing a furtive glance at us; then, as he slowly
shook his head, replied—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>“I and my people will be here after you are
gone, and if I was to do so the Abyssinians would
come down on us, burn our villages, kill our
men, and take our women and children as
slaves.”</p>

<p>I assure you, reader, that when that old man
shook his head he did not shake all the sense out of it.
There was a good deal of logic in his remarks, and
it is highly probable that had the old man accepted
the offer made, he and many of his braves would
soon have been translated (to use an orthodox
phrase), and the merry dollars would have danced
off into possession of the Dembelas; therefore the
old man “deserved well of his country.” Indeed,
his diplomatic action would almost entitle him to
the appellation of a grand old man, though he did
not look it.</p>

<p>February 12th.—The stillness of the night fortunately
was not broken by the clash of arms, and I
awoke, refreshed by a sound sleep, at 6 a.m. Whilst
we were at breakfast Mr. F. James proposed that
we again ask Sheik Hoodoo to let us have 200 of
his men to assist us in making a raid on the enemy,
and if he would not, that we should send the
caravan back to the last camping place, and take
about 20 of our own, as we were not at all satisfied
to leave poor Mahomet (who might still be living)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
to his fate. Hoodoo was accordingly approached
with the same result as before, he adding—</p>

<p>“I am at peace with them, and I cannot make
your quarrel mine.”</p>

<p>The old man was about right. Six camels had
yesterday been sent to Amadeb, a garrison town,
for dhurra. We therefore had to divide their loads
with the remaining camels. When most of the
camels had their loads on, we told our men that we
should want some of them to go with us. This
(with the exception of about half-a-dozen) they
flatly refused to do, saying that they were engaged
as camel-drivers not to fight the Dembelas. They
were evidently bent on retreating from the Abyssinian
frontier whether we were or not. Suleiman,
who knew these people pretty well, now stepped
forward—</p>

<p>“What good you gentlemen go fight Dembelas?
You only six or seven, the Dembelas hundreds.
You do no good. Mahomet, he dead now, and the
vultures eat him. If you go, these men go off with
their camels. How, then, we get out of the country?
The Basé and Abyssinians then turn round and kill
us all.”</p>

<p>This was good reasoning. Abdullah now brought
my camel ready for starting, so—pending the settlement
of “to be or not to be”—I spread my rug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
on the ground and lay down to read a book, with
my rifle by my side. It was now about 11 o’clock.
I had not been here above ten minutes when I saw
everyone rushing across the camp, rifle in hand,
shouting—“Hakeem,” and “Doctor, doctor—quick!”
I was up in an instant, rifle in hand, and
darted across in the same direction as the others,
naturally thinking—“The time has come at last. We
are in for it now with the Dembelas.”</p>

<p>It was not an attack at all, but a most pitiful
sight. There was poor Mahomet, who had managed
to crawl into camp, then sank exhausted on the
ground. The poor fellow turned his large soft-looking
eyes piteously on to me. He was supporting
with his hands and tope as much viscera—covered
with sand dried on it, and quite adherent—as
would fill a good-sized washing-basin. My rifle
was at once dropped for my dressing-case; water
was obtained, the opening (made by a spear)
slightly enlarged, the viscera washed, replaced
in the cavity of the abdomen, and the opening
secured by a suture or two. He was in a state of
collapse, and death pretty certain. He had also a
wound in the fleshy part of the arm, and two others
in the muscles of the back, just by the spine. Whilst
I attended to these, some extract of beef and
brandy was obtained, a fire soon kindled, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
a good supply of brandy and beef-tea, administered,
which soon revived him. An angarep was then
rigged up, and twelve of the Basé (six at a time)
were told off at a dollar each to carry him on to the
next camp. I followed close by, giving him brandy
and beef-tea every half-hour; but all was of no
avail, for he died at 9 o’clock next morning. He
was a Mahomedan. A tope as a shroud, with some
needles and thread, were given to the friends.
They would not, however, use the needle and thread,
preferring the shreds of the palm leaf. A grave was
dug near the camp, and there the poor fellow was
buried; Suleiman remarking, “These Basé, they
soon have Mahomet up; they not leave that good
tope there long.” And I have no doubt he was
right in his prediction.</p>

<p>Mahomet’s account of the scrimmage, and his
escape to camp, was this: He stated that when
the Abyssinians, or Dembelas, said “aman” it
meant “Put down your arms and take your lives;
we are stronger than you, so you must give up all
you have.” He noticed that they were tremendously
out-numbered, so thought it was the best thing to
do. When he saw Mr. Phillipps trying to recover
his rifle, another Abyssinian was about to strike
him with the butt-end of a rifle; he rushed to his
assistance, and it was then he received the fatal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
spear thrust in his abdomen, causing him to fall
down on the sand, where he received two or three
more, as detailed before. When everyone ran away, he
tried to struggle on, succeeding ere night came on
in getting pretty near to camp by alternately walking
and resting awhile, until at last he sat under a
tree quite exhausted. He says that he both saw
and heard us when we were returning after our
search for him, and that he cried out, but could not
make us hear. The greater part of the way to
camp next morning he accomplished by crawling on
his hands and knees.</p>

<p>Who can imagine the sufferings of the poor
fellow—out all night, sitting with his back to a
tree? He said he felt the cold very much; and
well he might, as, although the thermometer
registered 101°F. in the shade at 1 p.m., it dropped
to 37° by 11 p.m. He passed the night in constant
expectation of a wild beast coming to tear him in
pieces. We were very glad that we had him with
us during his last few hours, where he received
every attention that we could bestow.</p>

<p>February 13th.—Mahomet was buried, as I said
before. Little was done to-day; one nellut and
three gazelles were shot.</p>

</div>

<p>February 14th.—Made a rather short march, and
encamped at Aibara, on some table-land by the
Mareb. Ere doing so we had to clear away a
quantity of mimosa bushes and young palms; then
construct a zareeba. Mr. Phillipps, at the request
of one of the Basé, shot a monkey to-day. This
was skinned and eaten by them in the evening, and
was, no doubt, looked upon as a delicate morsel,
probably as much so as grouse or partridge is with
us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>February 15th.—This morning, at 9 a.m., Messrs.
Phillipps and F. James went off to Amadeb, to complain
to Rasalulu, a deputy of King John of Abyssinia,
about our late attack, and endeavour to get
their rifles back. Whether they ever succeeded
in doing so I don’t know; but I should think probably
not.</p>

<p>To-day we lost another camel; this makes the
sixth we have lost in the Basé country. A camel is
a particularly stupid kind of animal, and does not
seem to know what is good for him, or rather, what
is bad for him, for he will frequently eat a very
poisonous green-looking shrub, called “heikabeet.”
This appears to produce considerable pain, and,
as far as I could make out, inflammation of the
intestines. I brought some of it home with the
intention of having it analysed, but somehow or
other it has got lost.</p>

<p>February 16th.—The Basé women and children,
when we first came here, were rather shy, and ran
away from us as if we were monsters of iniquity;
now they appear to be getting quite tame, and are
continually hanging about the camp. The heads of
the children are curiously trimmed, according to
fancy, just as they are at Kassala. All kinds of
fantastical devices are arranged, with the aid of a
razor, just as a gardener operates on a box bush in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
England. I have seen a child’s head shaved completely,
with the exception of a tuft of hair just over
the right temple; another will have a tuft on each
side, whilst a third will have those and one on the
crown in addition; another will have several other
little islands, and another a tuft running from the
forehead to the back of the head, just for all the
world like a clown in a circus, and so on.</p>

<p>Ali Bacheet to-day injured his foot with an axe.
I bathed it, and whilst getting a bandage one of the
Basé diligently employed himself in sucking it,
then rinsed his mouth two or three times with the
bloody water which had washed his foot. This I
thought was a somewhat nasty proceeding, but I
did not waste my breath in expostulating with these
men of primitive habits.</p>

<p>Five tetél were shot to-day. In the evening our
men with the dhurra from Amadeb returned.</p>

<p>February 17th.—Last night our camel-drivers,
with their singing, and hyænas howling and laughing,
much disturbed our slumbers. This morning
the Basé here were very uneasy in their minds,
being under the impression that we had sent to
Amadeb for Turkish soldiers. However, I think
we made them believe—what really was the case—that
Messrs. James and Phillipps had gone to lay a
complaint about the Dembelas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>Just after dinner, whilst we were sitting round
the camp fire smoking the pipe of peace, the camel-men
whom we had hired at Kassala came in a body
to us, saying they wanted to return to Kassala,
stating as a reason that they were afraid of the Basé
and Abyssinians, they being so few in number.
We gave them distinctly to understand that we
were neither afraid of them nor the Basé; for the
latter we had plenty of bullets if they interfered
with us, and for our camel-drivers who did so we
had the coorbatch, and so we dismissed them to
chew the cud of reflection.</p>

<p>Two tetél shot to-day by Messrs. Colvin and A.
James, and several beautiful birds by me. We are
passing a very peaceful and calm existence at present,
little to do except to amuse ourselves as fancy
dictates. Some go out on horseback in search of
antelopes or buffalos; I generally content myself
just here with taking out a shot-gun after breakfast,
prowling round in quest of some of the
beautiful plumaged birds which are so numerous,
and in the afternoon write up my diary and prepare
letters for post. After that read one of the many
interesting books which we have until 6 p.m., when
we all have our evening bath, just before dinner,
which was always ready at 7 p.m. After dinner
we sit round the camp fire and chat over the social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
pipe, when some go to bed, and I skin and prepare
my birds to bring home.</p>

<p>We had a capital library with us, and were never
short of most interesting works, such as Macaulay’s
Essays, Sir Samuel Baker’s “Nile Tributaries,”
Trollope’s, Dicken’s, Thackeray’s, Disraeli’s, and
other works.</p>

<p>February 18th.—A young baboon and a small
monkey were captured yesterday; this day they are
quite tame, allowing us to stroke them without
exhibiting any signs of fear. Unfortunately the
young baboon had been injured in the thigh by a
spear which severed the muscles, causing the wound
to gape very much. The flies annoyed him so much
that I determined to put him under chloroform, and
bring the edges together by means of two or three
silver sutures. I therefore put him on the table,
where he lay as quietly and sensibly as any human
being, looking up at me with his nice brown eyes in
a very human-being like kind of way. He almost
seemed to say, “I know it is for my good, doctor;
don’t hurt me more than you can help, and be quick
about it.” He took the chloroform very well, and
when complete anæsthesia had been produced I
relinquished the post of chloroformist to an assistant,
with suitable instructions. He, however, was
so intent in watching the operation that sufficient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
air was not admitted with the anæsthetic, the result
being that just as I had finished putting in the last
suture our poor little friend looked to all appearance
dead. I at once set up artificial respiration, but to
no purpose—the vital spark had fled.</p>

<p>Two Basé sheiks from Kokassie visited our camp
to-day. They had a short pow-wow both on their
arrival and departure. They kissed our hands profusely—overdid
it, we thought; we were apt to
look with suspicion on an excessive manifestation
of friendship.</p>

<p>February 19th.—Just after breakfast I picked up
my gun, intending to take a stroll in the neighbourhood,
when Elongi, the Koolookoo Sheik, taking
hold of my arm, led me to Beyrumfi, to whom he
communicated some important information, which
he in turn communicated to Suleiman in Arabic,
and the latter to me thus—</p>

<p>“You not go out this morning, doctor. The
Sheik, he say, 300 or 400 bad Basé have come about
the mountains by us, and they come bym-bye to kill
us all.”</p>

<p>I regret to say that Suleiman’s indignation caused
him to indulge in profane language, and he expressed
a strong wish to know “What the d—l dese black
rascals meant. We find them plenty meat; we give
plenty presents to them; we kind to them always,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and now dey want to kill us all.” Then, turning
abruptly to Beyrumfi and a cluster of Basé, he
opened a box full of rifle cartridges, and very angrily
said, “Tell dese black d—s, and dey can tell de
other Basé, that we will give them some of dese
bullets, and that we kill one, two hundred of dem
in five minutes.”</p>

<p>Beyrumfi translated this pleasing intelligence to
his hearers, who, in due time, I dare say, passed
it on. Elongi and his men swore they would
stick to us, and I believe they would; but for
all that we did not allow any Basé to sleep
within our zareeba. We had become rather lax in
the matter of zareebas lately, and had not constructed
one here; but I need hardly say that on
hearing this all in camp were soon set in motion, I
remarking what a fine field this would be for Mr.
Gladstone to indulge in his tree-felling propensities.
He would have found some ebony trees well worthy
of his grand old arm.</p>

<p>We had a great deal of very fatiguing work for
hours, not only in cutting down and dragging in
a sufficient number of trees to form our zareeba,
but also in felling young palm trees just round
the camp. When all this had been completed
the country was set on fire. This quickly
spread for miles. In the midst of it all Messrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
James and Phillipps returned from Amadeb much
surprised at the activity in camp. We soon gave
them all the news, and I cannot say that we were
altogether surprised at the information we received
in the morning, as we had observed a good many
camp fires in the night—all over the hills—where
no camp fires should be.</p>

<p>February 20th.—Last night we went to bed,
leaving sentries posted round the camp, and well
prepared to give a good account of ourselves should
the Basé have conceived the idea of attacking us.
Perhaps Suleiman’s timely admonition and explanation
respecting the penetrating power of our bullets
deterred them; at all events we were not attacked,
which was satisfactory both to us and the Basé.
Had they done so, I computed that with our 22
rifles and guns, and about a dozen revolvers, protected
by our strong zareeba, we could have polished
off about 100 of these poor savages every five
minutes, which would have been no satisfaction to
them or us. Looking at the matter again in another
light, had they come in sufficient numbers, or laid
siege to the camp, we should inevitably have gone
to the bad, which would have been a decided inconvenience
to us, to say the least of it. Our
comrades informed us that when they arrived at
Amadeb they heard that our late disaster had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
telegraphed to Kassala, Cairo, and, of course, to
England. I then felt glad I had sent a true version
of the affair to England, knowing full well that wild
reports, of a most unreliable character, were more
likely to get abroad than true ones. From my youth
up I have remembered the story of the three black
crows; also that David once made a very pungent
remark, “I have said in my heart all men are liars,”
and Carlyle, “There are so many millions of people
in the world mostly fools.” However, respecting
the latter remark, I should say that—speaking from
experience—they are frequently not such fools as
they look. The former remark was rather a sweeping
one, not <em>quite</em> adapted to the present day.</p>

<p>To-day we moved on to Onogooloo, about two
hours beyond Koolookoo. On passing the latter
place Elongi and many of the Basé remained
behind, but his father, a quiet, peaceable-looking
old fellow, came on with us. This was a short
march of about seven hours only.</p>

<p>February 22nd.—This day, after a march of
about six hours, we arrived at our old camping
placed, called by the festive name of Wo-amma,
familiarly known as Whoa Emma. There we found
that, within the past 12 hours, quite a drove of
elephants had been past, and, of course, we were so
unfortunate as to miss them. The Basé are thinning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
off, but Elongi has rejoined us to-day. To-day
my rifle barrel was so hot at 5 p.m. that no
one could grasp it.</p>

<p>February 23rd.—Breakfast at 7 a.m. On the
march at 10, and encamp at Gebel-Moussa at 5.40
p.m. <i lang="fr">En route</i> we observed a large tract of country
on fire, and suddenly came upon a herd of buffalos,
which raised a tremendous cloud of dust. Of course
we gave chase for a short distance, and of course
did not get near them, for they can go at a tremendous
pace.</p>

<p>February 24th.—Life is more enjoyable, if we
have some difficulties to overcome occasionally, and
succeed in doing so; and if we do not, perhaps
(speaking as a philosopher) it is better than having
a quiet run of prosperity. To-day, like the past
few days, has been warm, 95° in the shade. Our
journey was short, namely, from 10 a.m. till 1.15
p.m., encamping at Abion. <i lang="fr">En route</i> we came across
many elephant tracks, a lion and lioness, and after
that a lion, lioness, and three cubs, but did not
succeed in bagging any of them, but three tetél,
a nellut, gazelle, and two bustards were shot. The
latter are remarkably fleshy, and very good eating.
Seldom a day passed without tetél, nellut, gazelles,
maarif, mehedehét or dick-dick being shot. The
latter is a beautiful little antelope of the smallest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
kind. I shot many very small, beautifully plumaged
sun-birds to-day—less than half the size of wrens—but
only managed to bring two or three of them
home, as the shot, small as it was, blew them all to
pieces; they ought really to be shot with sand.</p>

<p>It became known in camp that we purpose to-morrow
cutting across country for the river Settite,
or Tacazze, amongst the Hamran or sword-hunting
Arabs, <i lang="la">viâ</i> Sarcella. In consequence of this we
were told (just before dinner) that after that meal
we should receive a deputation of camel-drivers and
horse-boys to enter a protest against this plan.
Accordingly, just after dinner they came in a body,
saying that nothing would induce them to pass the
village of Sarcella, as the Basé there were bad
people, and they had just heard that they had
sworn to spear every man, woman, or child of the
Beni-Amirs that they encountered, on account of
the raid which Sheik Ahmed had made on them the
other day, just after he left us on our march into
their territory. This was the first news we had of
his performances there. They said that after making
“aman” with the Basé, he speared three or four
hundred of the men and took all the women and children
as slaves. We reproved them for their cowardice,
saying that they were not old women or children,
they had their spears and shields, whilst we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
had rifles and revolvers, and were strong enough to
make a two days’ march through their territory,
instead of one day. Our arguments were fruitless;
they were quite willing to go with us from Hiekota
to the Settite, but they would not, on any account,
pass by Sarcella. We, therefore, made a virtue of
necessity, and gave up the idea.</p>

<p>February 25th.—To-day we encamped at Toodloak,
having made a journey of seven and a half miles.
I captured a chameleon on the road. Panthers
rather disturbed us last night, and at 4 a.m. a
hyæna close to my tent exercised his risible faculties
so much that I, not seeing exactly where the laugh
came in, got up and saluted him with a shower of
stones. About 5 a.m. lions were heard; some of
us got up and went in quest of them, came within
about 40 yards of one, but he turned off into the
jungle when he caught sight of us. However, during
our stay in the Basé country 18 buffalos and about
60 antelopes, besides other game, were shot by members
of the party. We could easily have secured
elephants had we remained long enough and followed
them up, and many more buffalos and
antelopes had we remained longer in the country,
and, of course, giraffes and ostriches. The only
rhinoceros, or tracks of one, we did not find until we
reached Abyssinia. I have not enlarged much on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
hunting scenes, fearing that my book would become
bulky, and that the <em>generality</em> of my readers would
scarcely care to read a repetition of such scenes.</p>

<p>February 26th.—Heat getting great, 94° in shade
to-day. Another 7½ hours brought us to Heikota.
There we found quite a heap of letters, papers, and
periodicals from England.</p>

<p>The contents of the letters were, of course,
greedily devoured by us all, and as for the newspapers
and periodicals, they furnished enough of
news for days. Although many of them were fully
two months old, the contents were new to us.</p>

<p>About an hour after our arrival Sheik Ahmed
appeared and received us literally with open arms,
at the same time kissing us on either cheek. This
I could have put up with under different circumstances,
but I must say this mode of salutation is
not acceptable to me. We found from Herr Schumann
that the wildest rumours respecting us had
reached them—five had been killed by the Abyssinians,
two taken prisoners and put in irons, all
our men killed, whilst our camels and everything
else had been annexed. The Sheik says that had he
known of the attack in time he would willingly have
put 1,400 men in the field at once to assist us.
He gave us an account of his revenge on the Basé
at Sarcella after he left us, but there were some unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
little details which he prudently omitted,
thinking probably that they would shock our English
susceptibilities. The particulars Herr Schumann
furnished us with.</p>

<p>His tale was this—When the Sheik left us to join
his men at Sarcella they had about 500 of the
Basé in a cave; the Sheik arrived there quietly,
beseiged them for about 10 days, of course cutting
them off from water and food.</p>

<p>During this time they ate their goats and sheep
raw, quenching their thirst with the blood of these
animals. Finally the only course left open to the
beseiged was to place themselves at the mercy of
their merciless conquerors; so, driven by hunger,
thirst, and the smell of their dead, they crawled out,
weakened by want, in threes and fours. All the men
to the number of about 300, were speared on the
spot, whilst about 200 women and children were
taken into captivity and sold as slaves, realizing 30,
40, 50, 60, and 70 dollars each. About 30 remained
unsold on our arrival; these I saw next day. All
the cattle, sheep, goats, dhurra, and everything else
the Beni-Amirs could lay their hands on were seized.
Now we could understand why the idea of passing
through or by Sarcella was so repugnant to our men.
I have many patients to attend to, who literally appear
to hunger and thirst after my pills and medicine.</p>

<p>February 27th.—I was well employed at my
medicine chest again this morning. Amongst some
of my patients was a man who had followed us
about for weeks from Kassala, but had always
arrived too late to come up with us. Many others
whom I had attended before we entered the Basé<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
country also visited me, expressing their thanks for
what I had done for them, and presenting me with
a spear, a shield, an Arab knife, a gourd of wild
honey, a sheep, and other things; indeed, I met with
more gratitude amongst those poor Arabs than I
have in much more favoured climes where people
are well educated, and where the sentiment often is
very scarce, as well as the money.</p>

<p>February 28th.—This morning, about seven
o’clock, a great number of women and children
came close to camp making a great noise with the
accompaniment of the tom-toms and that peculiar
trilling note to which I have before alluded. It
seems that this was a complimentary serenade, and
that they were rejoicing at our deliverance from the
hands of the Philistines.</p>

<p>Yesterday was occupied a good deal in making
arrangements with Sheik Ahmed for a march on to
the Basé Settite. Mahomet Sali, who knows the
country well, will be our principal guide there. We
have not seen a flowing river since we left Kassala;
we hope soon to do so, and are told that we shall
find any number of nellut, gazelles, tetél, buffalos,
giraffes, hippopotamus, lions, leopards, crocodiles,
and plenty of fishing, besides monkeys, baboons,
golden-crested and toke or fish eagles, paroquets;
rollo-birds, and grouse, doves, guinea-fowl, partridges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
king-fishers, &amp;c., surely a sufficient assortment
of sport to satisfy the most ardent sportsman.</p>

<p>A start was not effected until two. Sheik Ahmed,
with some minor chiefs and a number of his people,
accompanied us a part of the way, which was an
uninteresting monotonous journey of about 10 miles
over a dry, dusty plain, the only vegetation being a
great number of mimosa bushes, not trees. The
only game observed on the way was a few gazelles.
Encamped at Falookoo, in Basé territory, at 5.30 p.m.</p>

<p>February 29th.—Marched from 10 to 4; encamping
on a wretched plain, where the fine dust was
about an inch thick, pitched our tents near to a
deep well at Sogoda. Several Basé came to salute
us. They do not seem <em>quite</em> so wild as those we have
lately been amongst, and most of them wear a tope.
This was not by any means an enjoyable journey,
as the roads were bad and mountainous, and covered
with intensely prickly trees, through which my
camel rushed me, and which lacerated my poor
face, legs, arms, clothes, and helmet in a dreadful
manner. Needles and thread were in great request
after dinner to repair the damage done to clothes.</p>

<p>March 1st.—This has been a long, tedious march
from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. All the discomforts and
thorn-scratchings of yesterday intensified six fold;
frequently men had to go on in front and cut down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
trees to enable the caravan to proceed. At 5 p.m.
we arrived at a river-bed, dug a well, filled our
barrels with water and resumed our journey. It
was past 12 at midnight ere we dined, and 2 a.m.
before we retired to our much-needed rest, which
we had very little of, as we were up at 6 a.m.</p>

<p>March 2nd.—Feeling stiff, sore, and tired. A
bath would have been most refreshing, but this
morning we were obliged to deny ourselves the
luxury because all the water obtainable was in our
barrels. Although our clothes and flesh have not
been so lacerated to-day, the march has been tedious
and very monotonous. For nine successive hours our
route lay through an immense forest of young mimosa
trees; these and a quantity of dry, withered grass
was all that we saw during the time, except a few
wild hogs, one of which was chased and speared by
a native. By 5 p.m. all our water was gone, and
the thirst of every one was excessive, the heat being
so great, 94° F. in the shade. After travelling 13
hours, we encamped at 9.30 p.m. by a broad, noble-looking
river, the Tacazze or Settite which lay like a
lake in front of our camp, either side being fringed
with shrubs and trees of all kinds, amongst the
branches of which brilliant plumaged birds unsuspiciously
roosted, little thinking that I should be
looking after them on the morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>This river was to us a most refreshing sight after
travelling hundreds of miles over burning deserts
and khors or dry river-courses, never seeing water
except by digging for it. It was 12 o’clock this
night ere we got our dinner. All are very angry
with Mahomet Sali, our guide, who professed, and
no doubt <em>does</em> know, the whole of this country and
neighbourhood well, for he has brought us, not to
the Basé, but the Hamran Settite, where there is not
very much game, as the Hamrans, or sword-hunters,
have destroyed it. This fellow told us on the way
that he would take us to the Basé Settite, within two
days or less of Abyssinia, where there would be
plenty of game of all kinds, and here he brings us
about three days out of the way. An unpleasant interview
and discourse will ensue with Mahomet
Sali on the morrow. Mr. F. L. James thinks,
rightly or wrongly I don’t know, that Sheik Ahmed
has instructed Mahomet Sali and Beyrumfi not to
take us to the Basé Settite, fearing we might get into
trouble, either with them, or, what was more likely,
with the Abyssinians. This place is called Geebau.</p>

<p class="caption">THE AUTHOR ATTENDING TO ARAB AILMENTS.</p>
</div>

<p>March 3rd.—Mahomet Sali was summoned before
the council just after breakfast, and his delinquencies
forcibly pointed out. What he said for himself I
do not know, as I picked up a shot-gun and rifle,
taking one of the boys with me to carry the rifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
and anything I shot. This river is full of crocodiles,
turtle, and fish. I was not long out ere a
crocodile received a bullet from my rifle. I also
shot a sacred ibis, a crocodile bird, and a beautiful
golden-crested eagle.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the big net was sent on a camel
some considerable distance down the river, where it
was rather deep, accompanied by most of our men
and ourselves. The river was dragged, and about
100lbs. of fine fish were secured, some weighing 10
or 12 lbs. The addition of fish to our dinner was
much appreciated.</p>

<p>March 4th.—The nights are now getting decidedly
warm, so much so that I sleep now with simply a
sheet covering me and both ends of my tent open.
To-day it is 94° in the shade. Last night Sali saw
a wild beast pass quite close to the camp just where
he was sleeping. Presently he heard him washing
himself, and indulge in a little vocal display. There
was no mistaking his note—it was a lion. Sali at
once called Mr. Phillipps, but could not get any
intelligible reply from him, as he was so excessively
sleepy, and knew nothing about it until next morning.
Others, however, were much vexed with Sali
for not letting them know.</p>

<p>Mahomet Sali was sent off this morning with
five camels and two men to the Hamrans to procure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
dhurra. We at the same time, 10 a.m., strike our
tents and start for the Basé Settite, to the great disgust
of our men, who manifest a decided disinclination
to visit that locality. We lunched at Khor-Maiateb
on a nice piece of table-land overlooking a
beautiful sheet of water, and shaded by tamarisk,
tamarind, and other trees. This place simply
swarmed with crocodiles. I saw a great many
Marabou-storks and two Egyptian geese; one of
the latter I managed to bag, and part of the
skeleton of a hippopotamus—the carcase of which,
I doubt not, had provided a rare feast for his
slayers.</p>

<p>After lunch we pushed on, and very soon travelled
over some vile country. First of all over very
stony road, then down a very steep declivity, over
rocks and big stones, next up a mountain side of the
same character—no road, no pathway even; then
along a mountainous pathway, through an awfully
sterile country, covered with nothing but leafless
trees, withered grass, and precipitous rocks, finally
encamping at Boorkattan, above the most gigantic
rocks of basalt, of great extent, these again overlooking
the river. We can see, probably a day’s
march from here, an immense tall mountain in
Abyssinia, on the summit of which is said to be a
fortress. We found the large footprints of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
hippopotamus in the sand by the river, and quite
expect to have him in the morning.</p>

<p>We find before night that we are in Abyssinia,
so that it is quite evident Mahomet Sali has not
adhered strictly to the truth, as here we are positively
in Abyssinia in one day’s march. I indulged
three times after our arrival in a bath in the river.
I dare not dive into any of the pools, fearing that
a crocodile might consider me a delicate morsel,
but picked out a kind of cradle on the edge, where
I could lie down comfortably.</p>

<p>March 5th.—We hear that there is an Abyssinian
village about seven miles from here, and that our
men are determined they will not proceed any
further than this camp. They also think that our
camp, pitched as it is on such elevated ground, can
be plainly seen by Abyssinians, who they quite
expect will make an attack on us to-day. Should
they do so, we should come off badly, as there are no
means of forming a zareeba. It is quite apparent
that they did not feel easy in their minds last night,
as a considerable number near my tent were chattering
away half the night, instead of going to sleep
or allowing me to do so.</p>

<p>After breakfast Beyrumfi was sent for. A great
pow-wow ensued, he definitely stating that we can
go no further without getting right among Abyssinians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
that the country is so rocky, wild, and
mountainous that hunting is impossible, and the
camels cannot travel there. Accordingly orders are
given to load up the camels and return to Khor-Maiateb,
where we lunched yesterday.</p>

<p>I had just fixed my bag, rifle, &amp;c., on my camel,
when Mr. Aylmer came running to me, rifle in hand,
saying, “Doctor, get your rifle and revolver ready.
Some of our men say that they have seen a large body
of Abyssinians coming down on us, some on horseback
and some on foot; but at present they are a
pretty good distance off.” Our caravan was nearly
ready to start. Of course we all armed ourselves
pretty quickly; then saw some of our camel-drivers
(one old fellow particularly) working themselves
up into a frenzy of excitement, leaping about like
lunatics, at the same time brandishing their spears
in a most threatening manner, indicative of what
would be the fate of the enemy should they appear.
As we looked upon this performance as so much
waste of time, we scruffed these fellows, boxed
their ears, and told them to make haste and load up
their camels, which they did with a will. As a rule
they are generally a couple of hours loading, but
now they were wonderfully quick, accomplishing the
work in half the usual time. We got off in safety,
and arrived at Khor-Maiateb in the afternoon.
Temperature, 95° in the shade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>March 6th.—Crocodiles are rather too common
here to be pleasant, and interfere with the luxury
of the morning and evening bath. To avoid
any unpleasant <i lang="fr">contretemps</i>, I generally collected
together several big stones by the side of a large
pool, threw them in one after the other to frighten
the crocodiles away, then threw myself in. This
device proved eminently successful, enabling me to
enjoy a plunge and a short swim. I need scarcely
say I did not fool about long in the water, fearing
they might return to see what white object was
swimming about.</p>

<p>To-day we used the large net, and landed 210lbs.
of different kinds of fish. Keeping sufficient for
our dinner, the rest was divided between our men,
who ate what they wanted, throwing the remainder
into the bushes or anywhere round the camp, causing
an insufferable stench next day, which we did not
get rid of until the fish had been all gathered up and
thrown into the river.</p>

<p>March 7th.—The little canvas boat is in great
request, and enables us to go a good way up and
down the river. The net was used to some purpose
to-day, for we landed 360lbs. of fish and one turtle.
At 12 a.m. about 20 Basé came to us with information
that elephants are not far off, as they saw and
heard them; also that on the 5th, near our last
camp, whilst they were looking for wild honey, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Abyssinians swooped down on them, killed several,
including the Sheik’s son, and stole three women and
a few children. No doubt these were the very
fellows who were coming down on us. When we
discreetly and gracefully retired, they found us
gone, and so seized the Basé. After lunch Messrs.
A. and W. James and Colvin mounted their horses
and went in search of the elephants. Temperature,
96° in the shade.</p>

<p>March 8th.—About 11 a.m. two or three Basé
(who accompanied Messrs. James and Colvin yesterday)
returned, saying that the latter had shot two
buffalos, one of which was killed, the other wounded
only, and that they had seen plenty of elephant
tracks but no elephants. At 4 p.m. they all returned,
having tracked and secured the wounded
buffalo, and an ariel. A crocodile, fish-eagle, and
an enormous horned-owl fell to my gun to-day.
Temperature, 98° in shade.</p>

<p>March 9th.—Temperature, 100° F. dry bulb, wet
bulb 71°, solar thermometer 156°. So far this is
the hottest day I have ever experienced. Whilst
bathing to-day I put my towel near the water’s edge
to stand on, as the stones were like hot coals to the
feet. We have cleared many of our followers and
men out of camp to-day. The Basé, Mahomet Sali,
Beyrumfi, and all the Beni-Amirs have been discharged
for misleading us. Messrs. F. James and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Phillipps have gone in quest of game, and Messrs.
Colvin, A. and W. James have returned to the same
place as before in search of elephants.</p>

<p>March 10th.—Last night seven or eight rifle
reports from the other camp reached us. At 1 p.m.
they were accounted for by Messrs. Colvin and
company, who arrived in camp. They had shot at
and wounded two buffalos (one a bull). Two or
three lions had attacked one of the wounded,
leaving very distinct marks of the struggle; still,
the buffalo had managed to go on. They tracked
him for some distance, but the heat became so great
by mid-day—101° in the shade—that they had to
desist. Another, wounded in the night, they
followed up nearly to the jungle, when suddenly he
darted on to them, charging most furiously in Mr.
A. James’ direction. He, however, saluted him
with two eight-bore bullets in the chest, which had
the effect of turning him from his purpose, and
causing him to change his plan, for he turned and
then charged Mr. Colvin, who, very fortunately for
him, happened to give him a bullet in the fore leg at
very close quarters, as the buffalo fell right against
him with some violence, and sent him reeling on the
ground. I should think this was about as close to
an enraged wounded buffalo as Mr. Colvin or any
other man in his senses could desire.</p>

<p>We could very frequently get a shot at a crocodile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
when in the water, but seldom on land; they seem
much too wary to be caught there. I have often seen
them basking in the sun on the bank of the river,
crept cautiously up, and whether they have seen
me, smelt me, or I have trodden on a twig I know
not, but before I could get near enough they have
all disappeared in the water. They come up to the
surface often. We see a dark spot in the middle of
a quiet-looking pool, and take a pot-shot, but seldom
get the reptile until next day, when we find him
floating, but so mutilated that he is not worth
securing. To-day, however, Mr. Aylmer shot one
in the water near the camp, and was fortunate
enough to secure him by the aid of a native, who
dived into the pool with a rope, which he slipped
over his upper jaw. I fancy crocodiles prefer white
skins to black, for these black fellows plunge into
the water and swim about where we would not dare
to go.</p>

<p>Before the crocodile episode—in fact, just after
breakfast—our court of justice sat. This consisted
of ourselves, who were the judges, the jurors, and
the counsel; and I venture to say that strict justice
was dealt out with an even hand. The culprit was
a fine, strapping, rather good-looking fellow of about
six feet, a camel-driver. He had been troublesome
on two or three previous occasions, but last night he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
passed the bounds of discretion. His brother roused
him up in the night to take his turn at sentry-duty;
in return for this he warned his brother that he
would make him suffer in the morning—which he
certainly did, as he got him under some trees and
there chastised him severely with a stick. When
we heard of this, the culprit, prosecutor, and witnesses
had to appear before the tribunal. The
charge was proved, and the culprit was ordered 20
lashes of the coorbatch, to be administered by
Suleiman, four camel-men to hold him down. He
at once dispensed with the assistance of the camel-men,
and without making any bother at all, laid
down on the sand, face downwards, whilst Suleiman
went in search of the coorbatch. The castigation
was duly administered, the fellow taking it without
flinching an atom. When finished he got up, brushed
the dust from his tope, and walked off in his usual
manner. He seemed not to bear the least malice,
for some time afterwards he was as busy as anyone
helping to land the crocodile.</p>

<p>March 11th.—Two bull buffalos, a tetél, and
nellut were shot to-day. Scorpions are too plentiful
here; we are continually finding them in our
tents, but so far none of us have received any of
their dreadful stings. They belong to the class
<i lang="la">Arachnida</i>. A scorpion has what looks like a claw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
in his long tail, through which the poison, which
lies in a bag at the bottom of it, is projected. This
tail, preparatory to taking the offensive, lies curled
up on his back, not unlike a squirrel. He can at
will bring this down with considerable force, but
only in a straight line—he cannot twist it to strike.</p>

<p>Whilst strolling up the river-bed with my gun in
the afternoon I came upon Mr. W. D. James, who
had just met with a rather curious, and not altogether
agreeable, adventure. He had brought his
photographic apparatus with him, and planted it
within a convenient distance from a pool, intending
to photograph gazelles when they came to drink.
He was successful in obtaining a good picture of
two—one drinking, the other looking straight at the
camera. Whilst waiting patiently for them, seated
on some rocks under a large baobob tree, he heard
a hissing noise behind him. On turning his head,
he saw a snake waving about in an erect position,
with tongue out, looking as if he was about to strike.
Mr. W. D. James did not sit on the stone any longer,
but seized a stick, and was lucky enough to kill it
ere he was able to bite.</p>

<p>About a week ago we set some mustard and cress;
to-day we had a good quantity for luncheon, and
found it a very agreeable addition.</p>

<p>March 12th.—A few Hamrans called to-day, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
are very anxious to persuade us to go towards
Abyssinia, saying they are friendly with the Abyssinians,
and can show us hippos. The offer is not
accepted. I find these fellows do not by any means
confine their hunting tendencies to simply the use
of the sword, as I have often found very ingeniously
constructed snares plentifully placed in runs leading
to the river. Doubtless when the animals are thus
ensnared they are despatched with the sword or
spear.</p>

<p>I will try and describe the kind of snare: They
get a strong branch of a tree that will bend, not
break, into a circle; this they firmly secure. They
have a number of strips of wood, broad at the base,
and gradually getting narrow, converging until they
meet in the middle of the circle bent downwards on
one side; these again are firmly secured to the
circle. A hole, perhaps a foot deep, and half a foot
or a foot in diameter, is dug in the ground where
the run is. On the top of this hole is placed the
snare, covered with earth, attached by a strong
rope to a great log, or the trunk of a tree. The
unsuspecting animal comes to drink, puts his foot on
this, and it slips in. He cannot pull his leg out, for
the harder he pulls the more firmly is he secured,
as the sharp spokes stick into his flesh. It is, in
fact, just like a wheel: the tire is the outer circle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
and the axle represents the hole through which his
leg goes.</p>

<p>The reason the Hamrans are called sword-hunters
is this—I am quite sure that neither I nor
any of our party can speak from experience, as we
never saw the feat performed, but Sir Samuel
Baker has: Whilst hunting the elephant, or
giraffe, a Hamran on horseback gallops in front
of an enraged elephant armed with a sword, whilst
one behind, similarly armed, gallops after him. The
elephant may elect to turn round and chase the one
behind—in any case, he is between two evils, for
eventually the one behind, whilst the horse is going
at full gallop, will, when he is near enough, jump off
and with great dexterity hamstring the elephant
with his long two-edged sword; then, of course, he
can easily be despatched. His tusks are cut off and
sold, and his carcase provides a good feast.</p>

<p>Two Basé who had remained in our camp slipped
off to the mountains on seeing the Hamrans in our
camp, returning again after their departure. It is
quite evident they do not regard them as friends.</p>

<p>March 13th.—This morning several Hamrans,
with the late Sheik’s son, interviewed us, and
seem very desirous of acting as pioneers in this
part of the country. We declined their services.
This seems displeasing information to them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
they also express anger at our having two Basé in
camp. On leaving us they went towards the Basé
country. Suleiman explained this by saying, “The
two Basé in our camp, they go soon as they see these
Hamrans. Now he go after the Basé; they kill his
father long time ago. Now he kill all the Basé he find
if he strong enough and have plenty of mens with
him.” This was really the case, and the Hamrans
were now hunting the Basé just as we would wild
animals. However, they had a good start, and
probably made the best of their way to their
country.</p>

<p>Our camels were now being loaded, as we had
resolved to move our camp. Whilst we were preparing,
a Hamran came, saying he was sent to tell
us that we had given the Heikota sheik a number of
presents, but they had nothing to do with him.
We were now in the Hamran’s country, or soon
would be, and they were not willing for us to kill
their game without permission from their Sheik,
adding that if we advanced they would fire on us.
Our reply was, “Tell your friends that our camels
are loaded, and so are we. We are coming your
way in less than half-an-hour, and strongly advise
them to save their powder, as that is a game that
two can play at. Threats don’t alarm us in the
least. If they are ready to commence hostilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
so are we.” I suppose they thought better of it.
Shortly afterwards we started without hindrance
until we got just beyond our old camping ground, by
the Settite, where our tents were then pitched. There
were two hippopotami in the river just here, one
of which we saw. The river was dragged, but they
slipped under the net.</p>

<p>March 14th.—Marched from 8.30 a.m. until 2.30
p.m., encamping on a high, flat table-land overlooking
a beautiful sheet of water plentifully bordered
on the bank by trees and bushes in which could be
found any number of beautiful birds and doves. At
the back of our camp was a large wood on perfectly
level ground, which gave shelter to myriads of
guinea fowls, doves, and other birds, also vast
numbers of baboons. The occupants of the water
were crocodiles, turtle, and very numerous different
kinds of fish. The shore, a little way from camp,
was frequented by Marabou storks, flamingoes, ibis,
cranes, storks, Egyptian geese, herons, crocodile-birds,
&amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>This was the most enjoyable camping ground we
had yet come to. It was also the hottest place we
had hitherto found, for the temperature at 2 p.m.
to-day was 105° Fah. in the shade. During such
hot weather a bath was of course a most delicious
thing to indulge in, but I must say I did so with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
some trepidation, as the pool in front of us was
frequented by some good-sized crocodiles whom it
was as well not to trifle with. I therefore contented
myself, as a rule, with lying down in the
water on the edge where it was shallow. When feeling
inclined for a plunge and swim I invariably adopted
the preliminary caution of hurling in several big
stones; on these occasions I was sufficiently discreet
not to remain long in the water, having conceived
a very wholesome objection to furnishing
any of these scaly monsters with such a repast as a
Williams. The water was quite tepid, of course
from the great heat. This place is called Omhagger,
not far from the village of Ombrager.</p>

<p>In the evening, whilst George and Anselmia, our
two European servants, were dining by their tent,
George called out, “A snake, a snake.” A little
terrier, named “Tartar” (which Mr. W. D. James
had brought from England) began barking furiously,
whilst we sallied forth with anything we could lay
our hands on—Mr. Phillipps and I each with a spear,
Mr. Colvin with an Abyssinian sword—darted off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
just in time to see a great boa-constrictor gliding
through the grass and into some thorny bushes
where we could not pursue him.</p>

<p>George said, “I heard something hissing,” and
said to Anselmia, “What the devil is that?” looked
round and saw an enormous snake about a yard off
in the tree behind me, hissing away, with head up.
I was off in quick sticks. Last night a lion came
so close to my tent, and made such a noise that he
woke us all up, and produced quite a stampede
amongst the horses and camels. Some of the
natives sleeping just outside my tent threw firebrands
at him. Unfortunately the moonlight was
wanting at the time or we might, perhaps, have
bagged him.</p>

<p>Two tetél, four ariel, and several birds were shot
to-day.</p>

<p>March 15th.—Hyænas were rather noisy last
night, but I have never known them so troublesome
anywhere as at Kassala. The heat to-day
was 106° in the shade—so far the hottest day I
ever experienced. Of course the Burton boat is in
frequent use now. To-day, whilst quietly punting
about near the bushes with my gun laid across the
seat, I observed some beautiful and strange birds.
I quietly seized my gun, and found the barrel so
excessively hot that I positively could not hold it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
until I wrapped my pocket-handkerchief round it.
I succeeded in bagging two fine spotted giant king-fishers.
This morning Moussa, a mischievous young
rascal, whom we had brought with us from Kassala,
was severely thrashed with the coorbatch, then sent
away with our head camel-man (who was going for
dhurra) to the Sheik at Ombrager, to be forwarded
on to Kassala. It seems that he had quarrelled
with Idrees, a native servant from Keren; then,
whilst struggling together, he whipped out a pair of
scissors and with it snipped out several bits of
flesh from his arms and chest. This was not his
first offence, for on the 13th he received 20 lashes
of the coorbatch. Then he laid himself down at
once, face downwards, and took it without flinching;
to-day he got it severely, and yelled most
vigorously. His offence on the former occasion
was this: Whilst Sali was running to camp, rifle
in hand, this impudent young scamp struggled
with him for the possession of it (this was just
after dark). In the struggle the rifle went off,
and might have lodged a bullet in Sali or anyone
in camp. Unfortunately the coorbatch is the only
remedy for these natives—the only way of keeping
up discipline. If treated with kindness and forbearance
they think we are getting lax and easy,
will at once take advantage of it, skulk about and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
do nothing, but the coorbatch at once brings them
to reason.</p>

<p>Mr. A. James found a man’s skull to-day, also a
gigantic tortoise shell. Mr. Phillipps angled and
caught an enormous gamout, weighing 31 lbs. Two
ariel, a nellut, and calf buffalo were shot.</p>

<p>March 16th.—Temperature 105°, wet bulb 71°,
solor 160°. Last night hyænas and wild cats exercised
a disturbing influence on our slumbers. Soon
after breakfast a Hamran Sheik, with attendants,
called, presenting us with a good quantity of milk
and a sheep. During the day a crocodile was shot,
also a very fine hippopotamus. The latter was
observed poking his head above water in a large
pool a little way from camp, little thinking of the
danger awaiting him. He had no sooner done so
than crash went a hardened bullet into his skull.
Down he went, but could not stay long, for he must
come up to breathe. On his reappearance he received
another leaden messenger in his skull. On
his coming to the surface a third time he spouted
up a quantity of blood and water, and received one
more bullet, after which he disappeared mortally
wounded. The next time he came to the surface a
floating corpse. A few hours afterwards ropes were
obtained and fastened round him by some Arabs,
who dived, and he was dragged to shore amid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
universal rejoicing, they knowing right well that a
feast was in store.</p>

<p>We find the white ants very troublesome here.
Should anyone be careless enough to leave his
satchel or portmanteau on the bare ground he
would regret it in the morning. Anyone who has
visited Central Africa will come away with very distinct
recollections of the white ants. They are really
wonderful little creatures, and the structures they
erect are often on a colossal scale. Quite near to
our dining place here is one of their buildings. As
a rule they are built of a conical or sugar-loaf
form, but I have seen them of the form of turrets.
They are worked up from the soil of the country
by the ants, and are of the consistency of stone,
and so strong that a buffalo or leopard has been
known to take up its position on the top for the
purpose of observation. During one portion of our
journey, on emerging from a wood, I saw what I
at first took to be a village on a large plain; the
habitations resembled huts, in some cases 15
feet high, and proportionately large at the base.
They were only a colony of white ants, and I dare
say their village consisted of 200 of these ant
hills. The white ants (<i lang="la">Termes bellicosus</i>) are not
true ants; that is, they do not belong to the order
<i lang="la">Hymenoptera</i>, which embraces the industrious bee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
and the crafty ichneumon, but belong to the order
<i lang="la">Neuroptera</i>, which embraces the brilliant, though
voracious dragon-fly, the ephemeral may-fly, and
the wily ant-lion. They are called ants because
they are similar to them in their habits and in the
constitution of their colonies. Their antennæ are
larger than the head, their mandibles are well-developed,
and the inferior pair of wings is
generally as large as the superior.</p>

<p>There are four classes found in the colony of the
white ant—the king and queen, who live together
in a central chamber near the ground, after having
lost their wings; the workers, who build and nurse
their young; the soldiers, who never build or nurse,
whose duty consists in defending the nest when
attacked. Neither the workers nor the soldiers
have wings. The largest worker is supposed to be
a fifth of an inch long. The soldiers, which have an
enormous head and formidable mandibles, are at
least twice as long, and are said to weigh as much
as thirty workers, attaining the length of nearly
four-fifths of an inch, while the female, when she
has become a queen, and about to form an extensive
colony, attains the length of six inches, and lays
eggs at the rate of sixty a minute, or more than
eighty thousand a day. The white ants are most
destructive to houses, furniture, clothes, and books;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
they will, in fact, destroy anything but stone and
metal. Anything that is reducible to powder will,
where they have located themselves, fall to certain
destruction. They work unseen. I have often
noticed twigs, leaves, branches of trees, and so on,
destroyed by them. They plaster them over with
mud, and underneath this cover they work.
Wooden pillars and beams are continually made
perfect shells by their operations, and the safety
of houses is frequently affected, though externally
they would appear strong and good. The library
at the Faurah Bay Church Missionary College,
Sierra Leone, was in a great measure destroyed
by their instrumentality.</p>

<p>In 1879 the Bishop of Sierra Leone appealed for
funds in order to repair the churches, which, he
said, “are ant-eaten.” Now, although the white
ants are so annoying that hardly anything is proof
against their attacks, they are a great blessing in
tropical climes, their office being, in the economy
of nature in these hot countries, to hasten the
decomposition of the woody and decaying parts
of vegetation, which, without their intervention,
would render these regions uninhabitable by breeding
a pestilence. The remains of the white ant in
the Coal Measures is an evidence that it was, to a
certain extent, through their destructive agency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
that the tropical vegetable matter was accumulated
which went to form our coal. The white ant, by
hastening the decomposition of vegetable substances,
has ever proved a friend to man; the true
ants also have proved themselves a boon to the
inhabitants of tropical climes by destroying what
are popularly classed as vermin.</p>

<p>March 17th.—I am happy to say that the temperature
has dropped to 97°, and that is quite as hot
as one cares about. Whilst breakfasting, about
6 a.m., a native came, saying “Assint effendi,”
at the same time jerking his thumb towards the
river. This meant a hippopotamus. He was accordingly
sought for, found and killed before 8 a.m.,
not far from camp. To see the Arabs then cutting
up the carcase, wallowing in gore, and stuffing
lumps of meat or fat into their mouths, and rubbing
the latter on their heads was a most disgusting
sight, almost as bad as the Basé. Festoons
of meat soon ornamented every tree in the neighbourhood
of the camp. The natives themselves
looked like a number of dips melting in the sun.
Every head to-day is dripping with fat, which melts
and drops about all over the shoulders. Feeling a
little Mark Twainish, I cannot help remarking that
this plastering of the head with fat is, no doubt,
a very ancient custom, in which Aaron, his friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
and contemporaries were accustomed to indulge
to a great extent. Do we not read? “And they
annointed his head with oil, which ran down even
unto his beard.” This was probably the fat
obtained from hippopotamus, buffaloes, &amp;c., and
clearly indicates that these old gentlemen were,
more or less, affected with sporting proclivities; but
it is more than probable that they were not at that
time in possession of eight-bore rifles and hardened
bullets.</p>

<p>During the greater part of this day we have
observed a peculiar hazy appearance on the other
side of the river—extending for miles—resembling
mist in appearance. It was really a very fine dust.
In the evening this was followed by a good deal of
wind, which much increased towards night.</p>

<p>March 18th.—Last night and this morning was
cooler than any for weeks past. Temperature at
1.30 p.m. 92° in the shade. Mahomet Sali put in an
appearance to-day with a camel-load of flour and
bread from Kassala. He also brought the skin of a
very fine boa-constrictor, which one of our party was
not long in annexing. It really was intended for
George, but the annexer gave the owner two dollars
for it, and so it became his pretty quickly. The
bread we have is like the Cairo bread we brought
with us. It is baked hard in squares, resembling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
dog-biscuits. When wanted at meal-times they are
dipped in water and then put over the fire for a few
minutes, when they become spongy and eatable.</p>

<p>Two or three little matters conspired to ruffle me
rather last night. When retiring for the night my
first business was to kill two scorpions and some
gigantic spiders which I found in my tent. Having
accomplished these murders to my entire satisfaction,
I undressed, lastly taking off my socks. I had
no sooner put my feet on the matting than the soles
of my feet felt as if they were pin-cushions, receiving
a thousand prickling sensations—sometimes not
unlike those produced by a galvanic battery. I
found on inspection of the matting swarms of large
black ants. This was not all. I got into bed, but
was not allowed to sleep without the accompaniment
of a stringed instrument, somewhat resembling
a banjo, which a wretched Arab had constructed
out of an empty preserved meat tin. He had
stretched a piece of skin tightly across this, attached
a bridge, three strings, a finger-board, and all the
rest of it, then strummed and fingered away close to
my tent, producing the most monotonous sounds for
an hour or two after I was in bed, evidently as
much in love with his instrument as someone else
would be with his violoncello. I had not done anything
deserving such torture as this wretch thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
proper to inflict on me, so would not stand it any
longer. I therefore got up and delicately conveyed
a hint (in the shape of a boot which I hurled at
him) that this mode of serenading in the middle
of the night was not only unappreciated by me,
but decidedly objectionable. The stringed instrument
ceased for a while until I was just
going to sleep, when this demon in human form
again started. I immediately threw out three
more rather forcible hints. They were another
boot and two empty claret bottles; and I rather
think the last two hints appealed forcibly to his
feelings, as the light guitar was then laid aside,
and I was allowed to sink into a calm sleep.</p>

<p>During the day Mr. W. D. James shot a magnificent
buck nellut, which had the finest head we have
yet seen. His horns, taking the direct length,
measured 39½ inches; taking the curves, 53 inches.
An enormous tortoise was brought to camp this
morning alive (abugeddir, as they called him).
Two stout men can stand on his back, and he walks
away with them as if they were two straws.</p>

<p>March 19th.—Temperature, 92° in shade. The
hazy appearance noticed during the last two days
has passed away; the wind also has subsided. I
think we may expect a hot day again.</p>

<p>This morning a son of the Hamran Sheik came to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
camp, demanding a tax of eight dollars on our
guide. The latter is to receive 25 dollars per
month, out of which the Heikota Sheik wants eight
dollars. To begin at the fountain-head, the
Egyptian Government have a head-tax—every
young person on reaching a certain age is taxed.
The owner of every date palm-tree has to pay a tax,
the same with the owner of a “sageer,” or sakia
(a water-wheel); in fact, I believe everybody and
everything is taxed. The Government look to the
Governor-General of the Soudan for a good round
sum; he, in turn, looks to the Mudir, or governor
of a district. He squeezes the necessary out of the
sheiks of the various tribes, and they in turn (to
use a metaphor, suck the orange dry) screw out of
the poor Arabs of the tribe what they require. If
the sheik fails to produce the sum required of him
by the Mudir, the latter swoops down on his camels,
flocks, and herds and sells a sufficient number of
them to produce the required sum; but if the sheik
has no camels, &amp;c., he himself is seized and put in
durance vile until the tribe find the necessary
number of dollars.</p>

<p>How can Egypt ever prosper under such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
system? What inducement have these poor Arabs
to accumulate anything more than is sufficient for
their daily wants? None. When we engaged
servants at Heikota, at, say, 12 dollars per month,
the first thing the sheik did was to take two dollars
from each man, and very probably as much, or more,
at the termination of their services. The beasts,
the ants, the reptiles, and birds prey on one another;
crocodiles on big fish, and big fish on little ones.
There is no Salvation Army there, and if there were
(I don’t want to be ironical, but <em>Byron</em>-ical) I do
not think there exists a more preying community.</p>

<p>Two nellut and a maarif shot to-day.</p>

<p>March 20th.—This morning, just after breakfast,
I took up my gun and went about 100 yards from
camp, with the intention of shooting a baboon.
But my heart smote me—they looked so awfully
human—and I desisted; but I sat down and derived
much amusement from watching enormous baboons
and little monkeys gambolling by the water’s edge.</p>

<p>On returning to camp I found Suleiman conversing
with a man wearing a belt full of cartridges
(a rather uncommon spectacle). The conversation
lasted some time. I was told afterwards that when
he learned from Suleiman that we had been again
by or in Abyssinian territory, he exclaimed, “You
have to thank the good God that you came away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
when you did. Had the Abyssinians seen your
tents and all those boxes they would certainly have
come down on you and killed everyone of you for
the sake of the tents alone, to say nothing of the
boxes.” He also informed him that about a month
ago they killed a party of Hamrans, who went up
there hunting from this neighbourhood, just for the
sake of a gun or two, and whatever else they could
lay their hands on.</p>

<p>A buck nellut, two wild boars, killed; two buffalos
wounded. Temperature, 97° F. in shade.</p>

<p>March 21st.—Temperature, 100°. Nothing of
interest to-day. A tetél, two nellut, and mehedehét
shot; maariff wounded, but not secured. To-morrow
we turn our faces to the Red Sea coast,
and expect to reach Massawa in about three weeks
time.</p>

<p>March 22nd.—Last night, just as I was about to
retire for the night, I was sent for to Ali, the cook,
who had just been stung on the thigh by a scorpion.
He was evidently suffering great pain. I gave him
a strong dose of ammonia and some brandy, at the
same time advising him to poultice the wound after
I had cauterised it. Suleiman having more faith in
a more heroic mode of treatment, obtained a razor,
and with it made a series of little gashes, remarking
at the same time, “There, now Ali better after that;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the bad blood come from him now.” Of course I
did not interfere, but allowed them both to have
their own way, to their mutual satisfaction.</p>

<p>As we were now about to take our farewell of
the river, I indulged in a swim at 6 a.m., not forgetting
at the time to hurl in several large stones
preparatory to my dive, as a warning to all crocodiles
to vanish for a time.</p>

<p>At 10 a.m. the hamlah was on the move. Our
journey this day was pursued under very unpleasant
conditions, as we travelled frequently through large
bushes of mimosa and kittars, tearing our helmets
and clothes to pieces, and inflicting not a few
scratches on our bodies. At 7 p.m. we encamped
at Khor-Maiatah, about five miles from our old
camp. The day’s sport was a crocodile and
buffalo.</p>

</div>

<p>March 23rd.—Leaving Khor-Maiatah at 8.45 a.m.,
we had an exceptionally unpleasant day of it. We
had seen the last of that fine river, the Tacazze;
now if water was wanted it could only be obtained
by digging a few feet in the sandy river-beds. We
travelled over mountains, plains, valleys, river-beds,
and nearly all day through a forest of those horrid
mimosas, finally arriving at Lakatakoora, in the
Basé country, at 7 p.m., <em>without</em> the caravan. At
about 11 p.m. Cheriff, with the canteen, Ali the cook,
and a few only of the camels arrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>As we had not tasted food since about 1 p.m.,
Cheriff’s canteen was soon surrounded by us, and
the contents of it cleared out in a very short time.
Our dinner (which was a scanty one this time) did
not appear until 12.30 a.m. Whilst this was being
prepared by Ali we fired off rifles, burnt blue lights,
and lighted a beacon fire for Suleiman with the
hamlah to see where we were; but all to no purpose—they
had lost their way. The moon retired
for the night, and so many trees had to cut be down
to enable them to come on, that at last they gave
up the idea of attempting to find us, so slept out.</p>

<p>We also had rather a hard time of it. There was
no choice of a camping-ground—there was but one.
This was a large open space devoid of vegetation,
but covered with a thick layer of impalpable dust,
about an inch or so in thickness, infested with white
ants. Fortunately our tents and bedding arrived.
I did not wait for my tent to be pitched, but placed
my bedding on the canvas covering of my tent on
the ground, and there I managed to get through the
night in a rather unsatisfactory manner. The other
members of the party elected to remain up until
their tents were pitched.</p>

<p>March 24th.—I passed a somewhat uncomfortable
night amongst the white ants, lulled to sleep
by the music of hyænas, some of whom seem to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
have been intensely amused at our situation, if one
may judge from the bursts of merriment issuing
from <em>their</em> camp, as they were evidently excited
by uncontrollable fits of laughter, making the woods
in the immediate neighbourhood resound by the
exercise of their risible faculties.</p>

<p>I awoke about 6.30 a.m., but did not arise until
7. Quite near to our camp I observed on a precipitous
mountain side enormous basalt rocks,
some <em>single</em> rocks as big as a good-sized house.
This was the village of Lakatakoora; and amongst
these rocks, concealed from view, lived some Basé.
I had not been awake long ere many of the Basé
ladies, covered with beads, their eyelids and lips
stained with kohl, rings in their noses and ears, and
a strip of cloth around their waists, came and
shook hands with me, murmuring “Mida” (good-day).
Both men and women came in such increasing
numbers that I decided to get up, and had
to perform my toilet in their presence. They
watched the whole performance with evident
interest. Such a contrivance as a tooth-brush
and tooth-powder elicited expressions of wonder
and admiration, but a hair-brush and comb pleased
them still more. Water was scarce. I therefore
had to wash <i lang="fr">à la</i> Turk. Mahoom stood by me with
a salmon tin full of water, pouring out little driblets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
of water into my hands, finally douching my
head with the remaining drop, about two ounces.</p>

<p>Our guide had been sent off at 6 a.m. in search
of the lost portion of the caravan. He found
it, and piloted it into our camp at 8.30 a.m. The
Basé were very friendly and obliging in the way
of water, for they brought us this invaluable liquid
in very beautifully worked baskets, so closely woven
that not a drop escaped, slung on the shoulder,
like a pair of scales. They also brought us several
gourds of wild honey, which we bought. Many
beads and small looking-glasses were given to
the ladies, who appeared highly delighted and
amused when they saw their own faces reflected
from a looking-glass for the first time in their lives.
They crowded round the fortunate recipient of
one of these reflectors, peeping over one another’s
shoulders, giggling and laughing at their own reflection
in a most amusing manner.</p>

<p>All being packed up by 10 a.m., we moved off a
short distance, halting at Aboosalal at 12.30 p.m.
on the sandy bed of a khor, surrounded on either
side by lofty, precipitous rocks, along which
scampered hundreds of enormous baboons and
monkeys. Both men and camels seemed completely
knocked up. A little way from camp was
a little pool of water in this khor; and in the neighbourhood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
without exaggeration, were thousands
upon thousands of doves and sand-grouse. I took
my gun down there in the evening when they came
to drink, and stationed myself behind a huge rock.
In less than half-an-hour I bagged about 15 brace
of sand-grouse and five brace of doves.</p>

<p>The day before we arrived here the natives had
killed an elephant. They and the vultures had
picked his bones pretty clean, as nothing but his
skeleton remained when I saw it. His tusks, of
course, had been taken away. Later on they were
offered to me by a Sheik’s son; but as they were
damaged, small, and the price excessive, I was not a
purchaser.</p>

<p>March 25.—Made a long march from Aboosalal
to Sogoda, where water could be found. We started
soon after 8 a.m., and long before we reached our
destination darkness came on. This was a most
unpleasant journey through prickly trees, again
tearing our patched-up clothes and helmets. In
one place we all got separated, each one selecting
the way he thought best. I lost my way in a
forest of kittar and mimosa bushes. I was obliged
to dismount my camel, and presently got in such
a fix that I could scarcely move either backwards
or forwards. Noises became indistinct, and finally,
I could not hear a sound. Others were, apparently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
in the same position as myself, for shots and
revolvers resounded on all sides. Eventually we
reached the camping ground in detachments at 8,
9, and 10 o’clock, dining at 11 p.m., bed at 12.30.
In the evening, before dark, we came across the
trail of a boa-constrictor, followed it up, and successfully
despatched the reptile, which measured 12 feet
in length. The next day we pitched our tents at
Fahncoub, on very good ground, surrounded by fine
trees. Sogoda was a horrid place, the ground
being covered with fine dust.</p>

<p>March 26th.—Starting from Fahncoub at 8.30
a.m., we once more reached Heikota at 11.30, having
travelled a distance of 10 miles only. We found
Herr Schumann, the animal collector, had gone,
calling at Kassala, and taking all the animals with
him to Souâkin. I take the opportunity of sending
a letter on to Kassala by Alki, who has been a very
good trustworthy fellow, but who is now leaving us,
as he has a bad whitlow.</p>

<p>March 27th.—A great part of the morning was
occupied with sorting out the heads of antelopes,
buffalos, &amp;c. I was particularly engaged in
attending to about 50 patients in the morning, and
perhaps 20 or so in the evening. Many of them had
come from long distances to see the “Hakeem.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>In the afternoon a little Abyssinian boy, about 12
years of age (an improvisatore), made his appearance,
accompanied by his slave (a small black boy),
perhaps seven or eight years of age, carrying a rude
native instrument with three or four strings on it,
something like a banjo. He favoured us with a
song, in which the word “Ingelese, Ingelese” occurred
very frequently. The interpretation of the
whole song I do not know, but it referred principally
to the prowess of the English in the
Abyssinian war. On being asked if he would sell
this instrument, he replied—</p>

<p>“No, I cannot do that; it is my father and my
mother.”</p>

<p>The young rascal had saved up all his money and
bought the little black boy as his slave. He was
delighted on seeing a scrap-book and a small
musical box. These Mr. James presented him with,
also a dollar, which the youngster handed over to
his slave with quite the air of a superior.</p>

<p>March 28th.—To-morrow we hope to be on the
march once more. To-day we are much engaged in
securing fresh camels and camel-men for the march
to Massawa. I was employed for fully two hours in
the morning, and again in the evening, in relieving
the several necessities and tribulations of my Arab
friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>March 29th.—Physic again greedily sought for by
Hamrans, Beni-Amirs, Shukeriyahs, and Hadendowahs.
I was engaged in dispensing from breakfast
time until near luncheon time, and again all
the evening until dark. If we do not move away
from Heikota the medicine chest will soon be
empty, for these people seem to positively enjoy
mixtures and pills. In the evening, after dinner, all
our late camel-men and horse-boys were paid off, each
one receiving five dollars backsheesh, and a good
knife and a razor, which are much prized. I have
already spoken of the wonderful digestive powers
of the Basé people, but they exceeded my wildest
expectations, for on the 26th a circumstance
occurred whilst we were on the march that convinced
me they could digest anything from a boot
to a pair of trousers, even with a man inside of them.
Had anyone recounted the anecdote to me I daresay
I might have been somewhat incredulous, and
I cannot blame anyone, who does not know me, for
being the same. However, they can please themselves
as to whether they believe what I am going
to state or not. I can vouch for the fact as I saw it
myself.</p>

<p>In front of my camel, whilst on the march, were
two Basé. One of them found that a portion of his
sandal (made of buffalo hide) had worn away and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
came off; he was a careful Basé and wasted
nothing. Feeling rather hungry, the owner of the
sandal pounded the bit of seceding sandal between
two pieces of stone, and having done so began to
masticate it. The other Basé man, who had secured
a bit of the toothsome morsel, evidently thought
this a superfluous proceeding on the part of his
comrade, so incontinently proceeded to masticate
it without this preliminary precaution. Their teeth
certainly are good, even beautiful, and would be
envied by any drawing-room belle, and I am sure
their digestive powers would also be envied by any
individual living—no need of Richardson’s Peptacolos
here. I would recommend the party who
wrote about “The Stomach and Its Trials” to
peruse the above instructive anecdote.</p>

<p>March 30th.—This morning, after breakfast, my
tent was surrounded again with the patients, who
had arrived from all parts, far and near, on camels,
on donkeys, and on foot. Amongst them was one
old man who, after the approved native fashion,
squatted on his haunches, holding out a little
squeaking chicken, about a week or two old, at
arm’s length, calling out “Hakeem howaga”
(doctor, sir). This he continued at intervals for
about a quarter of an hour, until I had got rid of
many patients. What he intended this diminutive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
chicken for, unless as a present, I was at a loss to
understand; but when, at last, his turn came, I
soon discovered through Mahoom why the old man
was so importunate. Yesterday he came complaining
of his eyes. I then told him he must procure a
small bottle for some lotion. “And now,” said
Mahoom, laughing till he could hardly stand, “he
bring you dis little chicken.” What he thought I
was going to do with the chicken I don’t know,
unless he expected me to smash it up, and with it
make a lotion for his eyes. On my previous visit I
gouged out some diseased bone from a boy’s foot,
straightened the leg of another boy who had suffered
from a contracted knee, and so on. My fame spread;
hence the influx of patients suffering from all kinds
of diseases, curable and incurable. At 11.30 a.m.
we left Heikota, reaching Toodloak at 7 p.m., where
we encamped on very dusty ground.</p>

<p>March 31st.—Here we found a very large village
of Beni-Amirs encamped on the Gash, who may be
likened to locusts, as they remained at Heikota until
the animals had eaten up everything there; then
they moved away to pastures new. Toodloak is
quite a lion neighbourhood. An immense zareeba
had been constructed on the river-bed in a large
circle. Within this was an inner circle formed by
the huts of the tribe, and into that inner circle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
many hundreds of camels, sheep, cattle, and goats
are every night driven in for protection from the
wild beasts; yet, notwithstanding this, a lion will
sometimes leap the barrier and bound off with, a
sheep or a goat. Temp. 100° F. in the shade. The
nights are now much warmer than they were three
weeks ago.</p>

<p>April 1st.—Last night two lions, a lioness, and
two leopards were shot, and all secured except one
lion. We saw no less than seven or eight last
night. The lion was a very fine fellow, measuring
nine feet two inches from nose to tip of his tail.
Sali cut a bit of the lion’s liver, to make him brave,
as he said—a quite unnecessary proceeding, for he
once was plucky enough to enter the jungle in
search of a wounded lion, and that is what few
would care to do.</p>

<p>April 2nd.—Lions are plentiful here. Last night
they made a great noise round the camp, probably
attracted thither by the sheep and goats. The
Arabs had to mount guard over these, walking
round in couples with spears and shield, and shouting
to keep them away. Last night the party went
out in couples at considerable distances apart.
Each couple was ensconced in a small zareeba, in
front of which was a goat or sheep, tethered to a
stake driven in the ground, to tempt a lion. Opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
Mr. Colvin’s zareeba, whilst he was patiently
waiting inside for a lion to make his appearance, he
had the mortification to see one leap on to his sheep,
seize him, and bound off again with the sheep, pegs
and rope ere he could get a fair shot at him; he
discharged his rifle, but missed his lion. The heat
is so great to-day that it is quite uncomfortable to
walk across the river-bed in slippers—104° F. in
the shade. To-morrow we shall probably start
afresh, and pitch our moving tents a day’s march
nearer home.</p>

<p>April 3rd.—All astir this morning preparing for
the march to Amadeb, where we expect to find
letters and newspapers from England. We have
some tame monkeys and baboons in camp, which
are very amusing and playful. When we are at
breakfast some of them come and watch us, thankfully
receiving any crumbs of comfort we choose to
throw them. Although their movements are quite
unfettered, they make no attempt to leave us and
join their comrades who have not been civilized.
Baboons, which are very large and strong, will
sometimes form themselves into a limited liability
company for the purpose of attacking a leopard,
relieving one another at intervals; then, at last,
when they think a favourable opportunity has
arrived, all suddenly swoop down on him at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
They will often lay in wait for the goats and sheep
going to water, then go and suck them whilst they
are drinking; after which refreshing performance
these robbers, not liking to return to their mountain
fastnesses empty-handed, will take the liberty of
borrowing a kid from the flock. Last night, about
10 o’clock, we heard lions near camp. One came
pretty close to the horses, causing quite a stampede
amongst them; at the same time all the camels got
up, showing signs of great uneasiness. Lions are
very numerous here, hyænas few. When hyænas
predominate they will often attack a lion, and in a
very systematic way, too. A number will get in
front of him, and act as designing persons in
England sometimes do. They throw dust in his eyes,
then the whole pack will fall upon and make an end
of him. At such times both the lion and hyænas
make a great uproar. We heard them one night,
and Sali, who is an excellent tracker, told us that
hyænas were then attacking a lion. We hear that
Sheik Ahmed, with a number of the Beni-Amirs,
have made arrangements with the Basé for a shooting
expedition in their country, intending to go as far
as Maiambasar, then cross from there to the Settite.
They have a curious way of making themselves
agreeable out there. To make themselves acceptable,
they will take wives from amongst the Basé;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
then when they leave the country they leave them
behind, at the same time presenting them with a
piece of cloth, some dhurra, and, perhaps, a few
dollars.</p>

<p>April 4th.—Marched about nine hours to-day,
encamping in a very mountainous region. Whilst
the tents were being pitched, Mr. Colvin picked up
a book, went about a hundred yards from camp, and
sat down under a tree to read. He had not been
there long ere he heard something breathing near
him; looked round, and saw a hyæna within a <em>very</em>
easy distance. He naturally got up and made
tracks for camp, as he had no rifle with him. His
unwelcome interviewer followed him pretty closely
until he approached the camp. Soon after this,
very near to camp, one of them made for Dra, who
drew his sword and shouted. George saw him, and
at once gave him the contents of his rifle.</p>

<p>April 5th.—Marched from 8 a.m., reaching
Amadeb, a garrison town, at 8.30 p.m. We
travelled a very mountainous region to-day—in
one part, for the distance of a mile or two, over
large boulders of marble on the roadway. On
arriving at Amadeb, all were soon busy in reading
their letters from England. The Bey here treated
us with great consideration and kindness, providing
us with tea, sugar, milk, biscuits, and cigarettes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
whilst our tents were being pitched and we were
reading our letters. I had almost forgotten to
mention one very exciting incident during our
journey to-day, and it was this—All our party,
except Mr. Colvin and myself, had gone on considerably
in advance of the caravan (we were
travelling along a dry river-bed, consequently on
very open ground), when Suleiman came up in
great haste, saying, “Doctor, have you got your
rifle ready? The caravan is going to be attacked
in the rear;” and off he went to inform the others.
Colvin and I soon got our rifles and revolvers in
readiness, and trotted back to the rear, where we
found our men in a great state of excitement, leaping
about, brandishing their spears, and insanely
yelling, “Whoop! whoop!” which, of course, was
no use, but an inconsiderate way of spending time
and ventilating their feelings. Facing them were,
perhaps, 80 or 100 Bareas (akin to the Basé), indulging
in the same lunatic kind of performance.
Our reinforcements arrived, in the shape of George,
Anselmia, and the rest of the party. The Bareas,
seeing our strength, then vanished like chaff before
the wind. This was destined to be our last scare.
From the information we could gather, it seems that
the Bareas thought our numerous boxes were filled
with dollars, and (according to Dra and Girgas)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
began pointing their spears towards them as
if on hostile intentions bent. They retaliated by
pointing rifles at them, which had the effect of
inciting these fellows into a kind of war-like dance,
accompanied by a significant brandishing of spears;
and there is very little doubt that blood would have
been spilt had we not promptly appeared on the
scene.</p>

<p>April 6th.—Amadeb appears to be a tolerably
large place. The houses are made of mud bricks
baked in the sun, and are thatched. The whole
town is surrounded by a mud wall. As we did not
start until 3 p.m., I had many patients to attend.
At 5 p.m. we encamped on pretty good ground,
surrounded by trees, in which were thousands of
doves, about 16 brace of which Mr. F. James and I
soon knocked over, thus providing luncheon for the
next day or two. We found water here.</p>

<p>April 7th.—We marched from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m.,
a distance of about 30 miles. At noon we passed
a place where some thousands of camel, cattle,
sheep, and goats were being watered. Of course,
at this time of the year, all the river-courses are
dry, and the water has to be drawn up from deep
wells. The Beni-Amirs, and other neighbouring
tribes, are a pastoral people, and owners of enormous
herds, on which they wholly subsist. They produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
nothing, and seem to require nothing, except a few
yards of cotton. Their mode of watering the herds
is a very laborious one. On this sandy river-bed I
observed about 20 very large but shallow mud-basins,
and close to each basin a well. At the top
of each well is an Arab, provided with a large
antelope skin (dressed), fastened around the sides,
and attached to a long rope. This skin he drops
into the well, and hauls up, hand-over-hand, full of
water, which he tips into the mud-basin until it is
full. With such insufficient means, of course, a
long time is occupied in filling the basins.</p>

<p>In the afternoon George, who had gone on ahead,
came back much excited, saying there was a
young elephant in a wood which could be easily
shot, adding that if he had had an elephant rifle
with him he should have been tempted to let fly.
It was fortunate that he had not, for presently we
met the owner of this captured elephant, accompanied
by a number of natives. They had halted
for a short time, and had secured the elephant to a
tree by a rope round the neck and leg. He had
been captured at Forfar. His tusks were just protruding.
Just as I approached him a native ran
up, saying, “Batal, batal howaga” (bad, bad, sir).
The man was right, for this infant had already
wounded five men severely. I, therefore, kept a respectful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
distance. The country through which we
travelled to-day was very mountainous, and here
and there big plains covered with bushes; still
nothing like so bad as the road before we got to
Amadeb.</p>

<p>April 8th.—Marched from 8 a.m. until 1 p.m.,
encamping at Gargee, situated on Khor-Baraker.
We stay here to-night, hoping to secure another
lion. Just after dinner we heard jackals barking
very much like dogs.</p>

<p>April 9th.—About 9 o’clock we were off again,
halting at 5.30 p.m. at Adatur, on the River Bogoo.
A fine leopard and hyæna were shot last night.
About 9 p.m., whilst I was writing my diary, alone
in camp, the others having gone out in search of
lions, a native came up to me, whispering, “Asset,
asset, howaga” (a lion, a lion, sir). It was a
lovely moonlight night, so light that I could see to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
read or write distinctly. I looked on to the river-bed
in the direction indicated by the Arab, and there,
40 yards off, I plainly saw a noble-looking lion. I
was not long in obtaining a rifle from my tent, and
following him up the river-bed; but to no purpose,
as he was too far off to risk a shot at him. Finally
he turned off into a large palm grove on the opposite
side, where, of course, I did not follow him. I am
told that about 14 years ago all this neighbourhood
belonged to Abyssinia, but now belongs to Egypt.
From this spot, not very far off, we noticed a most
precipitous mountain, called Chardamba, in Abyssinia;
it is almost inaccessible, and can only be
ascended by taking off one’s shoes and stockings, on
account of the smoothness of the stones, at least, so
Mr. Phillipps says. He and some of his party had
the curiosity to climb it last year, and nearly got
killed by stones being rolled down on them, for on
the very summit of this mountain dwell some monks
who have quite eschewed the pomps and vanities of
this world. Many of them are withered, shrivelled
old fellows who have lived there without once coming
down for the space of 30 or 40 years, and, to all
appearance, are one or two hundred years old. They
possess a deep well, a chapel, each one a separate
apartment or den, and they grow a little dhurra.</p>

<p>The next day we marched from 7.30 a.m. until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
5.30 p.m., encamping at Ashdera. On the road we
met, about 1 p.m., Ali Dheen Pasha, the Governor-General
of the Soudan (who succeeded Ali Riza
Pasha, a most unpopular governor). He was
coming from Massawa, and, I believe, going on
to Kassala. We had a very long pow-wow with
him. He informed us that our Abyssinian affair had
created quite a sensation in Cairo, that the Minister
of the Interior had telegraphed to him asking if we
were safe, and that the Mudir of Kassala had been
dismissed for not sending soldiers with us, which,
by the way, was not his fault, for we would not
have them. The palace at Massawa was built by
Gordon Pasha when Governor of the Soudan. This
Ali Dheen kindly placed at our disposal, until a boat
could take us to Suez.</p>

<p>On the 10th April a march of about 10 miles only
brought us to Keren, or Sanhît. Soon after our
arrival Réschid Pasha sent an officer, whom Ali
Dheen Pasha had sent on, to inquire if we had
arrived safe, and were comfortable. From here we
sent telegrams to Massawa respecting boats to
Suez. Although our journey was a short distance,
it took us a considerable time to accomplish it. I
should think, for about the distance of a mile, we
traversed a most precipitous ascent in a zig-zag
fashion; this was not far from Keren. On reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the summit we found ourselves in quite a different
kind of country. We soon paid a visit to the priests
at Keren, who have an excellent garden. They
kindly sent us some fine cabbages leeks, carrots,
potatoes, and lettuce. As we had not seen anything
of this kind for months they were, of course,
a great luxury for dinner in the evening. In
the afternoon the army doctor (who could speak
French tolerably well) called on me, and as I had
almost finished my campaign I gave him the greater
part of the contents of my medicine chest. In the
afternoon the tom-toms were set going, accompanied
by the peculiar trilling note of the women, to express
their joy at our arrival. They had heard that we had
all been killed by the Abyssinians, our men also,
many of whom came from here—Ali Bacheet, Dra,
Girgas, and Mahomet Zanzimeer. The latter was
thus called because he generally attended to our
zanzimeers when we arrived in or started from
camp. Pere Picard and another priest dined with
us in the evening. After dinner about 60 children,
well clothed, nice and clean, from their schools,
came to witness the mysteries of the magic lantern;
not only they, but Réschid Pasha, with a number
of officers, came also, and were much pleased.
When they took their departure rockets, together
with red and blue fires, were let off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>Keren, or Sanhît, is the capital and only town of
Bogos. It is 4,469 feet above the level of the sea,
on the edge of the highlands of Abyssinia, and on
one side of a table-land, about four miles long by
two broad, surrounded by hills. Being situated in
such a high position, it is healthy at all times of the
year.</p>

<p>This elevated plateau has for its southern
boundary the Abyssinian mountains, which come
down to within about two miles of the town, which
is built just outside the gates of the fort, and consists
of two short, broad streets of very poor Greek
stores, and some clusters of Abyssinian houses and
Arab huts.</p>

<p>About a mile distant across the plateau is the
French monastery. With the exception of the
Pasha’s residence, the monastery and its adjacent
buildings are the only respectable-looking habitations
there. They have an Amharic printing press
for publishing Bibles in the native tongue, schools
for educating Abyssinian boys for the priesthood,
also for the education of girls. When I was there,
about four priests and a few sisters fed, clothed,
lodged, and educated upwards of 80 boys and 50
girls. They had a good schoolroom, chapel, dormitories,
pharmacy, and harmonium, which latter one
of the sisters play. The children, who looked very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
clean and orderly, sang very nicely a hymn in French
for our especial benefit. These priests print, bind
books, have carpenter’s and blacksmith’s shops, a
dairy, vegetable garden, and appear to be a very
useful community, exercising, I should say, a great
deal of self-denial by residing in such a place as
they do. They cannot certainly have a very festive
time of it, for the Egyptian authorities regard them
as spies, while, on the other hand, the Abyssinians,
who distrust them, will not allow them into their
country. I must speak of these priests as I found
them. None of us were Roman Catholics, but
they behaved with very great kindness to us; and
we must award them a great degree of credit for
the civilizing influence they exercised amongst these
waifs and strays. The thought that occurred to me
was that if Roman Catholic priests could be doing
all this good, why not English missionaries also?
There is generally a garrison of about 1,000 soldiers
at Keren. There is scarcely any trade, as merchants
will not risk their lives and goods, knowing the
hostility of the Abyssinians, who are anxious for the
recovery of Keren and the lost province of Bogos,
added to which the Egyptian policy is to isolate
Abyssinia, thereby preventing the importation of
arms and ammunition for King John’s army. The
Beni-Amirs and other neighbouring tribes, who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
all owners of large herds, on which they wholly
subsist, are the Egyptian subjects. Fuel is scarce,
as it has to be brought from the Anseba valley,
four miles distant. Water also has to be brought
from a distance, but there is a well inside the fort
which supplies the garrison. Dhurra is dear, as
the continual dread of Abyssinian raids prevents
people from cultivating, also from building decent
houses. There are no camels, and very few horses
and mules.</p>

<p class="caption">MOUNTAIN PASS NEAR KEREN OR SANHÊT</p>
</div>

<p>I once tasted at Kassala a kind of beer made
from dhurra, called merissa, and thought it exceptionally
nasty. It is probably the same as that
mentioned by Herodotus, and is in common use in
the Soudan and Upper Egypt. I was again induced
by a native, who thought he would be attentive to
me for some little professional attendance I had
given to taste this vile liquid. Thinking, perhaps,
it might not be so nauseous as my last
dose, I drank some, and acted like a stoic and
philosopher, for I did not exhibit any outward and
visible sign of the rebellious feelings taking place
within. But “no matter;” I mentally resolved
that in whatever part of the Soudan I might at
some future time find myself, I would never again
degrade my esophagus by allowing any merissa to
glide down it, for I would just as soon have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
one of my own vile black draughts, and infinitely
have preferred a bottle of Bass’s pale ale. I have
no hesitation in saying that if merissa—a very
euphonious name, so much like Nerissa—was the
usual beverage in England, the Blue Ribbon Army
would find in me a very ardent supporter, as it is
more unpalatable, thick stuff than schliva (a Bosnian
drink, made from the juice of prunes, possessing a
strong asafœtida flavour). Merissa is made from
dhurra, which is allowed to germinate in the sun,
then reduced to flour by hand-mills. This, again,
is converted into dough, boiled, and left to ferment.
I hope that if I ever again pollute my lips with
merissa—not Nerissa—I may be served in the same
way, that is, that I may germinate in the sun, be
ground into powder, made into a pulp, boiled, and
allowed to ferment.</p>

<p>To-day a circumstance occurred in camp, illustrative
of a curious custom existing in the Soudan.
Dra, who has been with us as a native servant ever
since we left Kassala, is, we find, a slave. Some
altercation took place this morning between Dra
and another native, when the latter called him a
slave. This excited Dra’s anger to such an extent
that he talked about knifeing his accuser. However,
Messrs. James and Co. enquired into the
matter, and found that he was what they call a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
slave—what we should call a domestic slave or
bondsman—and that it came about in this way—Dra’s
father had, some time ago, “pinched” a
cow, <i lang="la">i.e.</i>, purloined it. He was ordered to pay
back two within a month; failed to do so. The
fine was then doubled every month, until he owed
about a hundred cows. As there was just about
as much probability of his being able to pay his
fines as there would be of my paying the National
Debt, he and all his children and children’s children
became bondsmen and bondswomen of the creditor.
Should Dra, who was single, desire to marry, he
would find it difficult, under such circumstances, to
obtain a wife; but should he succeed in doing so,
and children be born to him, all the males would
be slaves, and the females <em>compelled</em> to become
public women. This little matter was talked over
in the evening at the dinner table, when it was
ascertained that his freedom could be secured by
the payment of 35 dollars, which my colleagues
gave to the priests to effect his freedom with. They
say that papers will have to be made out and signed
by the Pasha at Keren, and that on payment of the
35 dollars he will be free. A man then goes round
the town with a trumpet, and proclaims the fact in
all directions. This, I am told, is quite typical of
the system in vogue here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 11th of April, at 11 a.m., we were once
more on the road to Massawa, encamping at 5 p.m.
at Gubana. Ere we left Keren a donation in aid
of the schools was given by the party, and the
priests very kindly sent us a sack of potatoes,
carrots, and parsnips. As we had been without
fresh vegetables so long, these were really quite a
treat. We descended from Sanhît into the Anseba
valley. About a mile from the town, in the lowlands,
were the gardens of the priests, full of
vegetables, growing in the most luxuriant manner.
The trees, too, flourished, and were covered with
beautiful green foliage. Here, on reaching the river-bed,
we found a little water actually on the surface.</p>

<p>April 12th.—To-day we travelled 10 hours
through quite a different kind of country to what
we have lately been accustomed. A great variety
of lovely plumaged birds are abundant in the
Anseba valley. Even the doves here are tinged
with bright yellow, green and blue. I managed
to secure some specimens of them, the brilliant
plumaged rollo-birds, paroquets, and a fine eagle.
Soon after starting our route lay up the side of a
frightfully precipitous mountain. The ascent was
made by a most tortuous pathway, where in very
many places the camels walked on the brink of a
fearful abyss. Having at last reached the summit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
of this mountain in safety, our descent was made
by an equally horrible pathway, after which we
travelled for the greater part of our journey along
a dry river-bed, surrounded on each side by steep,
precipitous mountains covered with large cactus
trees in full bloom, and gaunt, leafless, but enormous
baobob trees, and, of course, the never-to-be-forgotten
prickly mimosas, but I saw much less
gum arabic exuding from them there than I did in
the Basé country. Large tamarisk trees, also, were
numerous. The branches of all kinds of trees lay
scattered about in the greatest profusion, the natives
having chopped them off for the goats, sheep, and
cows to feed on.</p>

<p>On the 13th April, another 10 hours’ march
brought us to Kalamet, where we pitched our tents
for the night, having travelled through very wild
and picturesque scenery, the greater part of the
distance being along the river-bed of the Labak.
Water was very near to, and in some places on, the
surface. For a distance of about two miles we
journeyed along a very deep pass; on either side
of us extremely rugged, lofty, precipitous crags,
clothed with cactus trees and other bushes, through
which we occasionally discerned jackals and wild
goats peeping at us with astonishment. Scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
any birds of any description were seen this day.
The pass, I believe, is called El Ain; a representation
of it appeared some months ago in the <cite>Graphic</cite>.
Our camping and marching, like Bedouin Arabs, is
now nearly at an end, for in another day or two we
expect to reach Massawa, once more set our eyes
on the Red Sea, and a steamer, don decent apparel,
and return to civilized life.</p>

<p>Our next day, April 14th, was occupied in marching
to near Kamfar, a distance of about 27 miles.
This was an easy road for the camels, as the greater
part of the distance was along level ground, covered
with mimosas, more like the desert near Souâkin.
We came across a few jackals, ariels, gazelles,
falcons, and extremely beautiful diminutive sun-birds,
so small that they ought to be shot with
sand.</p>

<p>April 16th.—At 7.30 a.m. we once more, and for
the last time, mounted our camels, and made a good
march of about 32 miles, arriving at Massawa at
8.30 p.m. Some of our Arabs had never before
had an opportunity of seeing the Red Sea; now
that they did, their delight seemed great. We
should not have made such a long march to-day
but that a messenger had been sent from Massawa
to meet us with the information that an Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
steamer (Rubattino line) would be leaving on the
morrow, and that if we missed that we might,
perhaps, have to wait two or three weeks ere we
should get another. However, we did not intend
to wait, for we should have chartered a stambouk
from there to Aden, there catching a P. and O.
boat for Suez.</p>

<p>Massawa, the principal sea-port of Abyssinia,
is on a small barren coral island in the Red Sea,
about a mile long, by 400 yards broad, at the
northern extremity of the Bay of Arkeeko. It
is connected with the mainland by a causeway a
mile in length, built across the shallow water.
There are barracks and huts for about 1,000
soldiers. It is badly off for water. This has to
be carried two miles to the town. The town is
built partly of stone and coral, but most of the
houses are constructed of poles and bent grass,
and surrounded by a reed fence. The most considerable
buildings are the mosques, the houses
of the traders, and a few warehouses, which are
built of coral, and the bazaar.</p>

<p>The surrounding country is little cultivated, and
industry paralysed by fear of raids by the Abyssinians.
But little trade is done with the Soudan;
formerly a brisk trade was done with slaves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
that seems likely to be the case again. Most of
the imports come from Abyssinia. They are grain,
gold, cotton, manufactures, glass-wares, spices,
arms, cutlery, hides, butter, wines and spirits.
Principal exports, rhinoceros-horns, gold, ivory,
honey and wax.</p>

<p>As usual, vexatious export and import duties are
imposed by Egypt. No guns or powder are allowed
to be imported. There are very few camels, and
horses and mules are scarce and dear. The population
has been estimated at about 4,000. The island
is dependent on Egypt, and is ruled by a governor
appointed by the Khedive. The chief inhabitants
of Massawa are a few Greeks and Italians, an
Italian and French Consul, one Englishman, and a
small colony of Banians, through whose hands
almost all the trade passes.</p>

<p>On arriving at Massawa I took my leave of
camel riding, and cannot say I was sorry, having
ridden, probably about 2,000 miles on caravan
camels, which roared at me when I mounted them,
roared when I dismounted, roared if I passed
them, and roared if I looked at them. My knickerbockers
were just about done for, and I should
not like to say how many hours I had spent in
repairing them, on two occasions, with a girba cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
up. The Bey soon put in an appearance; had a bit
of a pow-wow; gave us coffee and cigarettes, then
showed us to the palace, where we had our camp-beds
once more unfolded.</p>

<p>April 17th.—So much had to be done to-day—paying
servants, selling camels, and tents, &amp;c., that
we found it impossible to get away. Word to
this effect was sent to the Italian steamer, so the
Captain has postponed his departure until to-morrow.
Abdullah, a negro, who had always seen
to getting my camel ready, helping to pitch and take
down my tent, and otherwise proved a faithful
henchman, presented me with his spear, and kissed
my hand. I rewarded him with a small pin-fire
revolver, 50 cartridges, a good knife, a razor, two
dollars, and my knickerbockers. His delight was
unbounded, possibly at receiving the last-named
unmentionables. I am told that at an island near
here a considerable pearl fishery is carried on, and
that at another island close by large quantities of
fine melons are grown.</p>

<p class="caption">THE CAUSEWAY AT MASSAWAH.</p>
</div>

<p>At 8.15 a.m. the next morning we took our leave
of the Soudan. The Bey had received orders to
pay us every attention. He accordingly sent a
gunboat, manned by sailors of the navy, with an
officer, and we were at once rowed off to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
steamer, bound for Suez. In the evening of
the next day, at 5.30 p.m., we anchored at
Souâkin. I and two others went ashore and
spent the evening with Mr. Bulay (who was
always most kind and obliging), returning to the
ship at 10.30 p.m. All sorts of dreadful reports
about the attack of the Dembelas on us had
reached him, which, fortunately, were not true.
Other startling news he gave us, such as that
the Queen had been again shot at; that Arabi
Pasha was getting a power in the State, and that
the Khedive was likely to be dethroned, and Arabi
substituted.</p>

<p>About an hour before we dropped anchor at
Souâkin some of our boxes arrived from Kassala.
We are likely to remain here two or three days
taking in cargo. The day before we left Souâkin a
French Consul and two American gentlemen (a
doctor and missionary, who were at Shepheard’s
Hotel in November last at the same time that we
were), came on board. They had been to the White
Nile. We have quite a menagerie on board—parrots,
paroquets, tiger-cats, jackals, monkeys,
baboons, extraordinary looking geese, two enormous
tortoises, and other animals. We took on board a
good many cattle for Suez, and left the Soudan for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
good at 9 a.m. next day, April 22nd, arriving, after
a very pleasant, but warm voyage, at Suez about 3
a.m. At 8 we went ashore and breakfasted at the
Suez Hotel. Of course Mr. Clarke, the excellent
and obliging manager of this hotel, related the
usual tale of our horrible massacre, &amp;c.</p>

<p>April 27th.—Heads and skins had to be sorted
out, turpentined, packed and sent by sea from Suez,
together with Mahoom and Girgas, the latter an
Abyssinian whom Mr. Phillipps is taking home with
him as a servant. On the 28th we left Suez for
Cairo, arriving there at about 5 p.m., where I
found several letters awaiting me—some of rather
old dates. Of course the wildest reports of our
massacre had reached Cairo, and been the topic
of the day at the time. Our stay in Cairo was of
short duration this time, as we found the Peninsular
and Oriental Company’s steamboat <i>Mongolia</i> would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
be leaving Alexandria on the 4th May. Messrs.
Colvin and Aylmer went on to India, but the rest
of us started for England.</p>

<p>Leaving Alexandria on the 4th, with a goodly
number of passengers, about 120, we had a pleasant
voyage to Venice, passing on the 5th the Morea, Navarino,
and Caudia, on the 6th Xante and Cephalonia,
and on the 7th arrived at Brindisi, viewing Montenegro
and Corfu in the distance. There we got rid
of the mails, and fully half the passengers, and at 6
p.m. on the 8th steamed up the grand canal, and soon
arrived at Venice, the Queen of the Adriatic, the
home of poetry and song. How pleasant it was to
find myself, after all this Arab life, comfortably
housed at the Hotel d’Italie, amongst civilized
people, I will leave the reader to judge. There
were a great many notables on board, amongst
them several ladies connected with officials in
Cairo. We knew that matters were a little unsettled
in Egypt at this time, and so drew our own
conclusions. These ladies were being sent out of
the way, and within 3 or 4 weeks after I had seen
the last of the great square in Alexandria it was
in ruins. There were on board big men and little
men, both in stature and in their own estimation.
There were fat men and thin men, agreeable and
chatty men, disagreeable and morose men, humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
and meek men, busy and sleepy men, easy-going
looking men, one or two of the “Ah! I see, thanks,
I’ll not twouble you” kind of fellows, Colonels,
Lieut.-Colonels, and other officers, Governors and
Judges returning home on leave of absence, and
genial, good-hearted, jolly sort of fellows. I acted
here, as I always do at home, avoided the starchy
“Ah! I see—not-twouble-you kind of fellows,” full
of their own importance, whose brains are concentrated
in their nicely-polished boots, &amp;c., and
fraternised with the sociable, sensible, good-hearted
kind. Amongst them was one of my own profession,
brimful of Hibernian humour and mirth.
He was a brigade-surgeon in the 68th in India,
where he had been for 25 years, and was now
on leave of absence. Dr. Kilkelly and I conceived
a mutual regard for one another. He and
I, with a Judge from Cawnpore, a Colonel and
Lieut.-Colonel, generally got together on the deck,
enjoying ourselves very comfortably until we parted.
I cannot remember all the jokes and witticisms of
our friend, Dr. Kilkelly, but I do remember one
circumstance that amused us all immensely, and
caused great laughter, as much in the way of saying
it as the thing that was said. We had been having
a great talk about the Soudan. When I happened
to say “Two of our party are going on from Cairo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
to India, and will not be in England until this time
next year,” the doctor exclaimed, “Sure, ye don’t
say they are going on there now? I could not have
thought a man in his senses would be going to
India now. Do ye know what it is like this time
of the year?”</p>

<p>“Hot, I suppose,” said I, whilst the others
smoked their pipes and looked amused, evidently
expecting some “rale Irish joke.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’ll tell ye,” said our humorous
friend, with a merry twinkle in his eye, and a
really comic aspect; “d’ye know, docthor, when I
have been in India this time of the year I have
often made the natives dig a grave for me to lie in,
half fill it with grass and pour buckets of cold
wather on me to keep me from melting. I’ll tell
ye another thing—cholera is so bad at this time of
the year, that, by the Viceroy’s orders, coffins of
all sizes are kept ready at the railway stations, and
when the ticket-collector goes round, saying, ‘Yere
tickets, plase,’ he finds a poor divil in the corner
who does not respond; looks at him, finds him
dead, pulls him out, finds a coffin the right size,
puts him in, and by St. Pathrick he’s buried before
the sun sets. Now what d’ye think of that? That’s
what India’s like this time of the year.”</p>

<p>Of course we all roared with laughter at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
voluble and comical way in which this was said,
and I mentally made a note that I should not start
for India in May for my first visit.</p>

<p>Amongst our passengers were two sons of Sir
Salar Jung, the Prime Minister of the Nizam of
Hyderabad, on a visit to England. The elder one,
though young, was a very Colossus, and an extremely
intelligent, agreeable fellow, who spoke
English fairly well, and was very chatty. He invited
me, if I visited India, to visit him, and
promised I should have some tiger-hunting.
Whether I shall ever do so, or he would remember
his promise, I don’t know—probably not. Dr.
Kilkelly and I put up at the same hotel (the Hôtel
d’Italie), and spent a few days very pleasantly. I
cannot say I should like to live in a place where, if
I enter my front door, I must step out of a gondola,
or if I want to visit a friend I must cross the street
in a gondola; but it is a charming place to pay a
visit to for a few days, especially for a person with
a romantic and poetic turn of mind, and although
romance has, to a great extent been knocked out of
me, I still have sufficient of the poetic temperament
to have been highly pleased with my visit to Venice,
short though it was.</p>

<p>Pursuing the course I have hitherto adopted, I
will not leave Venice without a brief sketch of it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
and my visits to various places of great interest,
although, perhaps, repeating an oft-told tale. The
man who ventures on a description of a visit to
Venice ought to be thoroughly imbued with romance
and poetry ere he can do justice to his subject.
Under such circumstances I cannot hope to rival
many another; but, as the Yankees say, “I’ll do
my level best.” On the evening of my arrival, I
met, by appointment, one of the officers of the
<i>Mongolia</i>, whom I accompanied to St. Mark’s Place.
The side of the Piazza facing St. Mark is a line of
modern building erected by the French, somewhat
in the style of the Palais Royal at Paris, but yet
having some sort of keeping with the edifices on the
south side. They are termed the Procuratie Nuove,
and form the south side, the Procuratie Vecchie the
north side. The end is composed of a French
façade uniting the two. Near the east end of the
Procuratie Nuove, just by the point where it makes
an angle with the Piazetta, stands the Campanile of
St. Mark. It is, in fact, the belfry of the Cathedral,
although it stands some considerable distance from
it. The separation of the belfry from the church is
very common in Italy, and there are a few instances
of it in our own country. On the summit of the
Campanile is a large open belfry to which you
ascend in the inside by means of a series of inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
planes. The sides of the belfry are formed by sixteen
arches, four facing each quarter of the heavens.
A gallery with a parapet runs round the outside.
I was told that the First Napoleon ascended the
inclined plane by means of a donkey. I, however,
had to walk it, and was well recompensed for my
trouble by the magnificent view obtained from the
summit. Southward lies the noble Adriatic, with
the Pyrenees to the right; northward the Tyrolese
Alps; immediately spreading round this singular
post of observation lies the city of Venice, map-like,
with its canals and neighbouring isles; and just
under the eye, to the east, is St. Mark’s Church,
considerably below, with its fine domes, its four
bronze horses, its numerous pinnacles, and in front
of it its three tall, red standards.</p>

<p>It is impossible to describe the effect produced on
the mind, on a summer’s evening, as the sun is going
down in his glory over the mainland beyond the
lagoons, lighting them up with his parting rays,
while the murmurs of the crowd assembled in St.
Mark’s Place ascend like the hum of bees around
the hive door, and the graceful gondolas are seen
noiselessly gliding along the canals. Traversing the
Piazza, we find ourselves in the Piazetta running
down from the east end of the great one by St.
Mark’s Church to the water-side, where the eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
ranges over the lagoons and isles. The next side of
this open space contains a continuation of the walk
under arcades, which surround St. Mark’s Place.
The upper part exhibits a specimen of the Italian
style, designed by Sansovino. The whole belonged
to the royal palace, or Palace of the Doges, which
extends along the south and west sides of the
Piazza. Turning round the west corner of the
Piazetta, on the Mole, with the canal in front, we
see another of Sansovino’s works, called the Zecca,
or Mint, from which the gold coin of the Republic
derived the name of Zecchino. In front of the open
space and landing steps of the Piazetta are two lofty
columns, which appear so prominently in the pictures
of that part of Venice. They are of granite, and
came from Constantinople—trophies of Venetian
victories in the Turkish wars. The right hand
column, looking towards the sea, is surmounted by
a figure of St. Mark, standing on a crocodile.
The left hand is surmounted by the lion of St.
Mark. The west front of the ducal palace forms
the east side of the Piazetta; the south front runs
along the whole, and looks out upon the sea. They
are its most ancient portions. The front, overlooking
the Piazetta, is composed of two rows of
arcades, one above the other; the lower a colonnade,
the upper a gallery, surmounted by a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
large and lofty surface of wall of a reddish marble,
pierced by fine large windows. One gentleman
says of it, “The ducal palace is even more ugly
than anything I have previously mentioned.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ruskin, on the other hand, says that,
“Though in many respects imperfect, it is a piece
of rich and fantastic colour, as lovely a dream as
ever filled the imagination, and the proportioning of
the columns and walls of the lofty story is so lovely
and so varied that it would need pages of description
before it could be fully understood.”</p>

<p>Having done the Campanile, and strolled round
the Piazza and Piazetta, we took our seats in the
Piazza. On the west and south sides, as well as
the north, the lower part of the buildings under the
arcades is appropriated to shops or cafés. The
latter are particularly celebrated. Towards sunset
the area of St. Mark’s Place is overspread with
tables and chairs, where ladies and gentlemen are
seated at their ease, as if in a drawing-room, taking
refreshments. A space in the middle is left for
promenaders, and when the military band is playing,
which it does two or three times a week, the concourse
is immense, and the scene very lively and
charming, enabling one to realise the saying of
Bonaparte, “The Place of St. Mark is a saloon of
which the sky is worthy to serve as a ceiling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>Having enjoyed the sweet strains discoursed by
the military band to our heart’s content, we took
our departure, my companion to his ship, and I to
my hotel.</p>

<p>The following day was occupied in various ways
by Dr. Kilkelly and myself. In the first place we,
of course, paid a visit to the Palace of the Doges.
If those walls could speak, how many tales of
horror and cruelty they could unfold! Our visit
to some portions of the Palace enabled us to vividly
imagine some of them. Of course, in many of the
trials here, whatever may be thought of the sentence
inflicted, guilt, and that of a heavy kind, was
proved against the accused. The place was not
always a slaughter-house for innocence, a butchery
for men guilty of light offence. Grave crimes
against the State were here disclosed, and the
memory especially dwells on that night in the April
of 1855, when Marino Faliero, a traitor to the
Government of which he was the head, was
arraigned before his old companions in office, and
when the sword of justice, covered with crape, was
placed on the throne which he had been wont to fill.
A very minute inspection of the Doge’s Palace was
not practicable, for two reasons; one was want of
time, the other the impatience of my friend.
Whilst in the Council Chamber of the Senate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
and for a minute or so looking at the largest
painting I ever saw in my life, “The Day of Judgment,”
my hasty friend seized me by the arm,
exclaiming, “Come along, do;” and soon afterwards,
when I was deeply engaged in the futile
endeavour <em>apparently</em> of dislocating my neck by
looking at the painted ceilings, and getting up the
requisite enthusiasm for the marvellous productions
of some of the masterpieces of Titian, Paulo
Veronese, and Tintoretto, I was told to “Come
along, docthor. Sure ye’ll have a crick in yer neck,
and not be able to eat yer dinner at all, at all, if ye
stand looking at the ceiling in that kind of way;”
and so I allowed my volatile friend to rush me
through the Palace of the Doges, coming away
with a hazy recollection of thousands of books,
wondrous paintings, the Council Chamber of the
Senate, before whom an undefended prisoner had
formerly appeared; the Council of Ten, where he
generally got deeper in the mire; the Council of
Three, whose decrees were like the laws of the
Medes and Persians; and, finally, the dungeon, or
condemned cell, just by one end of the Bridge of
Sighs, where he was strangled within, I think,
three days of his condemnation. I was also
shown a dungeon, but not so low down as the
condemned cell, where no ray of light could be admitted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
but where the poor wretch had a stone slab,
such as we have in our cellars, to lie upon, and let
into the wall was an opening through which the
Grand Inquisitor could calmly gaze on the torturing
process produced by the rack and thumb-screw, and
other ingenious but painful arrangements constructed
for blood-letting. Some of the blood of deceased
victims was shown to me on the walls, possibly like
the blood of Rizzio on the floor in Holyrood Palace,
renewed once a year. Of course there were many
objects of great interest in the Doge’s Palace that I
should have, no doubt, made many notes of had I
been by myself, but mental notes were all I was permitted
to take. Many people give a free rein to
their fancy, and argue much on the origin of species.
This is a free country, and I may form my own idea
of the General Post-Office. Suppose I were to say
that it originated from the Doge’s Palace? but fortunately
for us, with a more agreeable class of men
as letter-carriers. I remember to have seen a lion,
griffin, or “goblin damned,” at the head of one
staircase, with open mouth, whose sole object was
to receive accusations, true and false, against citizens
of the State, and woe betide him if he came
before the Council of Three, from whom there was
no appeal. Here our accusers have to prove us
guilty, there the accused had to prove himself innocent;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
and I doubt not that, in those dark ages of
cruelty, such a mode had its inconveniences, necessitating
a considerable amount of trouble for nothing
on the part of the accused.</p>

<p>We passed on from the Doge’s Palace to St. Mark’s.
This church is very ancient; it was begun in the year
829, and after a fire rebuilt in the year 976. It was
ornamented with mosaics and marble in 1071. Its
form is of Eastern origin, and it is said its architects,
who were ordered by the Republic to spare no
expense, and to erect an edifice superior in size and
splendour to anything else, took Santa Sophia, in
Constantinople, for their model, and seem to have
imitated its form, its domes, and its bad taste. But
if riches can compensate the absence of beauty, the
Church of St. Mark possesses a sufficient share to
supply the deficiency, as it is ornamented with the
spoils of Constantinople, and displays a profusion of
the finest marbles, of alabaster, onyx, emerald, and
of all the splendid jewellery of the East. The celebrated
bronze horses stand on the portico facing the
Piazza. These horses are supposed to be the work
of Lysippus; they ornamented successively different
triumphal arches at Rome, were transported by Constantine
to his new city, and conveyed thence by
Venetians, when they took and plundered it in 1206.
They were erected on marble pedestals over the portico<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
of St. Mark, where they stood nearly six hundred
years, a trophy of the power of the Republic,
until they were removed to Paris by Napoleon in
the year 1797, and placed on stone pedestals behind
the Palace of the Tuileries, where they remained
some time, until they were again restored to Venice.
In St. Mark’s I was shown two pillars of alabaster,
two of jasper, and two of verde antique, said to have
been brought from King Solomon’s temple, also two
magnificent doors, inlaid with figures of gold and
silver, and a very large crucifix of gold and silver,
brought from Santa Sophia. I was also shown the
tomb of St. Mark the Evangelist. How true all this
is I cannot say, but perhaps many of my readers
would like to know why St. Mark should be so much
thought of in Venice, so much so as to become the
patron saint, and have his name given to the most
celebrated and splendid of its churches. Over a
thousand years ago—to be precise, in the year eight
hundred and twenty-nine—two Venetian merchants,
named Bano and Rustico, then at Alexandria, contrived,
either by bribery or by stratagem, to purloin
the body of St. Mark, at that time in the possession
of Mussulmen, and to convey it to Venice. On its
arrival it was transported to the Ducal Palace, and
deposited, by the then Doge, in his own chapel. St.
Mark was shortly after declared the patron and protector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
of the Republic; and the lion, which, in the
mystic vision of Ezekiel, is supposed to represent
this evangelist, was emblazoned on its standards
and elevated on its towers. The Church of St.
Mark was erected immediately after this event, and
the saint has ever since retained his honours. But
the reader will learn with surprise that notwithstanding
these honours the body of the Evangelist
was, in a very short space of time, either lost or
<em>privately sold</em> by a tribune of the name of Carozo,
who had usurped the dukedom, and to support
himself against the legitimate Doge, is supposed
to have plundered the treasury and to have alienated
some of the most valuable articles. Since
that period the existence of the body of St. Mark
has never been publicly ascertained, though the Venetians
firmly maintain that it is still in their possession,
and, as I said before, positively show the
tomb which, they say, covers him.</p>

<p>Our next visit was to the arsenal. This occupies
an entire island, and is fortified, not only by its
ramparts, but by the surrounding sea; it is spacious,
commodious, and magnificent.</p>

<p>Before the gate stand two vast pillars, one on each
side, and two immense lions of marble, which formerly
adorned the Piræus of Athens. They are
attended by two others of smaller size, all, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
inscription informs us, “Triumphali manu Piræo
direpta” (“Torn from the Piræus by the hand of
Victory”). The staircase in the principal building
is of white marble, down which the French (who invaded
Venice) rolled cannon balls, an act of wanton
mischief quite inexcusable, at the same time they
dismantled the Bucentaur, the famous State galley
of the Republic—a very Vandal-like act.</p>

<p>Venice, when in the zenith of its fame, might
justly be said to bear a striking resemblance to Rome.
The same spirit of liberty, the same patriot passion,
the same firmness, and the same wisdom that characterized
the ancient Romans seemed to pervade
every member of the rising State, and at that time
it might truly be said of Venice—</p>

<p>WE HEAR OF THE MURDER OF LORD FREDERICK CAVENDISH
AND MR. BURKE—A GRAND SERENADE ON THE GRAND
CANAL—MY JOURNEY FROM VENICE TO ENGLAND.</p>

</div>

<p>Every evening during our stay in Venice, just about
the time we finished dining in the evening, a gondola
full of serenaders would take up their position
just beneath our open window, and sing some of
their charming Italian ballads in a very pleasing
style, undisturbed by the rattling of cabs and omnibuses.
Indeed, it seemed very strange, as we
wandered about this town of waterways, spanned by
about 360 bridges, never to see a vehicle or living
thing except human beings. Of course, the quietude
that reigned all round was very favourable to the
serenaders. One very favourite song, both with the
serenaders and visitors, was called “Santa Lucia.”
This, I think, we had every night, for, if they left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
this out of their programme, someone at the hotel
would be certain to ask for it. Venice, as all the
world knows, is noted for its glass manufactories.
To one of these, owned by Dr. Salviati, my friend
and I wended our steps. We were much interested
on going over the place, and much burdened on
coming out of it, as each of us emerged with an armful
of purchases. It was fortunate for me that my stay
was of short duration, as each time I returned to
my hotel after a stroll, I generally did so with an
armful of purchases of some description or other.</p>

<p>Dr. Kilkelly, whose residence was in Dublin, had
arranged with me that we should return to England
by a different route to that by which I had come by.
We intended to travel through the Brenner Pass to
Munich, then to Bingen on the Rhine, down that
river to Cologne, and on to England, but as we were
to have a grand serenade on the Grand Canal at
night, we postponed the journey until the morrow.
Soon after this, whilst walking along, a large poster
of the <cite>Standard</cite> newspaper attracted our attention,
announcing “The Murder of Lord Frederick Cavendish.”
A paper was soon procured, and there we
read the account of his murder and that of Mr.
Burke’s, dastardly deeds that all respectable Irishmen
blush to think of, and which excited the indignation
of my friend to boiling-point. This at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
altered his plans entirely. Said he, “I must start
home to-morrow. As head of the family I must get to
Dublin at once; perhaps the place will be under
martial law.” I then relinquished the idea of taking
our route, not caring to go by myself, and resolved
to spend another day or so in Venice, returning <i lang="la">viâ</i>
Turin.</p>

<p>In the evening the doctor, Mrs. and Miss P., and
myself made our way to the water-side, with the
intention of engaging a gondola to witness this
grand aquatic <i lang="fr">fête</i>. How we should have got on
with the gondolier I don’t know, as he could only
speak his own language; but, fortunately, I knew
just sufficient Italian to pull us out of the difficulty.
In whatever country I remain a few days, my first
business is to know the value of the coins and be
able to count in the language of the country. This
I have always found extremely useful, particularly
in Turkey, where the coinage is very confusing to a
stranger. A piaster is worth about 2d. There
they have silver, copper, metallic, and paper
piasters; and unless one knows all about the rate
of exchanging a Medjidie, the trusting individual
may possibly and probably be the victim of misplaced
confidence.</p>

<p>Having secured our gondola, we pulled up opposite
Danielli’s Hotel, a little way above the Doge’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
Palace. Here we found a large floating stage,
occupied by those who were to take part in the
serenade. It was profusely and very prettily
decorated with festoons of flowers and evergreens,
among which were interlaced a vast number of
variegated lamps (the centre piece forming quite
a tree of these little lamps). Under this stood
the conductor, whilst around him was the orchestra
and singers. This great stage started from opposite
Danielli’s Hotel, drawn by two boats. Following it
were hundreds of gondolas jostling one another on
the Grand Canal, each one trying to get as near as
possible to the stage. Those on shore took as much
interest in the proceedings as those on the canals,
for at every stoppage—and these occurred very frequently—a
performance took place. Opposite each
stoppage there was a grand pyrotechnic display by
those on shore. Our first halt was opposite the
Palace of the Doges and the Piazetta of St. Mark,
where numberless Roman candles, Bengal lights,
rockets, &amp;c., were let off, brilliantly illuminating
the far-famed old Palace, Piazza, Campanile, St.
Mark’s, and all the surroundings, and so on past
the hotels (once gorgeous marble palaces); the
Church of Santa Maria della Salute, on the opposite
shore; the Palazzo Foscari, the Academy of
Arts, and other palaces, winding up with a grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
scene at the Ponte Rialto. The time occupied was
about three hours, from 9 until 12 p.m. No
amount of word-painting can convey to the reader
an adequate description of the scene, which was
most enjoyable throughout. It was a beautiful
summer’s night—no moon, not a cloud; the blue
sky studded with bright twinkling stars, the stage
adorned with flowers, evergreens, and hundreds of
variegated lamps; no sound but the splash of the
gondoliers’ oar and jostling of the gondolas; a
stop, then sweet strains of music arising from
stringed and wind instruments and two or three
dozen well-trained male and female voices; and
every now and then the banks on either side
lighting up, by the illuminations, the grand old
churches and fine old marble palaces of the old
Venetian nobility, to each of which is attached a
history. It was a scene which I shall always remember,
but which I feel quite unable to describe
as I should wish. Our hotel was soon reached
when all was over, and I went to bed, lulled to
sleep by the sweet Italian music of gondoliers
which came floating on the midnight air as they
returned home after this grand serenade.</p>

<p>On the following day my friend, the doctor,
started for England. Soon after his departure Mr.
P. and I hired a gondola, and paid a visit to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Academy of Arts, some of the principal churches,
palaces, and various places of interest, and saw
some grand old sculpture, the tombs of Canova
and Titian, and paintings by Rubens, Titian, Tintoretto,
Paulo Veronese and others. I had resolved
on the morrow to forsake this dreamland under
the clear blue sky of Italy, and once more rouse
myself to the stern realities of life. Accordingly,
I found myself in the train next day at 9 a.m.,
with a ticket for Paris. Passing Verona, Padua,
and other interesting places, I arrived in Paris at
5.30 p.m. on the evening of the next day. A day’s
rest there, and I was on my way to dear old
England, which I reached in due time. A trip
abroad is mentally and bodily beneficial, but after
wanderings in various countries, I have come to
the conclusion that the most comfortable place to
<em>permanently</em> reside in, provided one is not absolutely
devoid of the “almighty dollar”—as the
Americans would say—is “perfidious Albion.”</p>

<p>I have travelled through the waving forests of
Austria, miles of charming vineclad slopes in Hungary,
acres of maize, rice, and tobacco fields near
Salonica, the beautiful cypress groves of Scutari,
near Constantinople, roamed over the wild mountains
of Bosnia and Montenegro, through classic
Greece and Italy, and traversed the burning sands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
of Africa; but, go where I will, nowhere is the
general appearance of the country so beautiful as
in old England, where we find the little cottage of
the rustic so prettily embowered amidst fruit trees,
shrubs and flowers, whilst all around are undulating
green fields, rippling brooks, and winding rivers.
Nowhere else is there anything to compare to our
pretty country lanes and variegated hedgerows,
covered with sweet-smelling hawthorn, the wild
rose, honeysuckle, and the red berries of the ash,
whilst the banks are adorned with foxgloves and
beautiful ferns, or white with primroses, cowslips,
and a thousand other wild flowers which surround
fields of waving golden ears of corn and the well-wooded
estates of the landed gentry, that in turn
give shelter to the fox, who will afford sport
in the winter, and to the hares, rabbits, partridges,
and pheasants, who will assist in satiating our
gastronomic propensities.</p>

<p>It is an Englishman’s privilege to grumble, and
whilst living here we often find a great deal to
grumble about, in politics particularly; but I don’t
think there are many who, having travelled abroad
continuously for six, twelve, or eighteen months,
will not say with me, on returning home once more,
“England, with all thy faults, I love thee still.”</p>

<p>“A plain unvarnished tale I have unfolded,” and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
as such, at this particular time, I trust it will meet
with the approbation of the <em>majority</em> of my readers.</p>

<p>Many faults, I am sure, may be picked out, as I
have not only written, but revised the book myself,
instead of employing (as some do) a skilled and
experienced reader. Even had I done so I should
still be able to say—</p>

<p>“The story of Chinese Gordon’s Life, full as it has been of
adventure and stirring incident, cannot fail to appeal to a wide
circle of readers.… The record of Gordon’s career would be
impressive under any circumstances; but it will be allowed to his
biographer that he has turned to good use the copious materials
placed at his disposal, and that this volume is worthy the fame of
its subject.”</p>

<p class="centerbold">Saturday Review.</p>

<p>“The contents of this book mainly relate to the two most prominent
questions of the day—the position of China as a fighting
Power, and the condition of the Soudan; and it appears therefore
at a most opportune moment.… The present volume will prove
a valuable guide to politicians at the present crisis, as well as a
welcome source of information to those who desire to learn more
than can be gathered from newspaper reports of the condition of
the Chinese and Army, and of the forces of the Madhi.”</p>

<p class="centerbold">Spectator.</p>

<p>“A fresh and connected account of his marvellous campaigns
against the Taipings and against Zebehr’s black brigade of Slavedealers

human pleasures; it reveals to us a singularly happy man.”</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
